# Goal

Visualize/summarize the results of sending resampled uncertainty matrices through pangolin.

# Vis Setup

Each row in the dataset represents a single sample from one uncertainty matrix (only dealing with one accession number for now). The columns are as folows:

- `taxon`: the accession name, followed by ".0" for the consensus sequence and "0.1" to "0.1000" for the 1,000 samples from the matrix.
- `lineage`: The called lineage from pangolin
- `probability`: the bootstrap support for this lineage call
- `pangoLEARN_version`, `status`, and `note`: extra info from pangolin

```{r}
unc1 <- read.csv(here("data/pangolineages/", "ERR4085809_pangolineages.csv"))
head(unc1)
```

To prep the data, I calculate another column called ""
