The code in this document takes the uncertainty matrices (from `parse.sam`) and finds the locations where the largest probability is less than 99.9%. That is, it looks for rows where there will be at least, on average, 1 sample out of 1,000 that have a different base.

To visualize these, any location where the effect is nearly certain is removed. The x-axis is labelled with the location of the base, the y axis is A, C, G, and T, and the tiles are coloured according to the probability (darker means higher probability).
