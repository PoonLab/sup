The model is applicable to magnitudes 3.0\textendash 8.5, distances 0\textendash 300 km, and spectral periods of 0\textendash 10 s. The model input parameters are the same as those used by Abrahamson and Silva (2008) , with the following exceptions: the loading level for nonlinear effects is based on the spectral acceleration at the period of interest rather than the PGA; and the distance scaling for hanging wall (HW) effects off the ends of the rupture includes a dependence on the source-to-site azimuth. Regional differences in large-distance attenuation and V               S30               scaling between California, Japan, China, and Taiwan are included. The scaling for the HW effect is improved using constraints from numerical simulations. The standard deviation is magnitude-dependent, with smaller magnitudes leading to larger standard deviations at short periods, but smaller standard deviations at long periods. Directivity effects are not included through explicit parameters, but are captured through the variability of the empirical data.},

Prior studies have uncovered macroecological drivers of viral sharing, but analyses have never attempted to predict viral sharing in a pan-mammalian context. Using a conservative modelling framework, we confirm that host phylogenetic similarity and geographic range overlap are strong, nonlinear predictors of viral sharing among species across the entire mammal class. Using these traits, we predict global viral sharing patterns of 4196 mammal species and show that our simulated network successfully predicts viral sharing and reservoir host status using internal validation and an external dataset. We predict high rates of mammalian viral sharing in the tropics, particularly among rodents and bats, and within- and between-order sharing differed geographically and taxonomically. Our results emphasize the importance of ecological and phylogenetic factors in shaping mammalian viral communities, and provide a robust, general model to predict viral host range and guide pathogen surveillance and conservation efforts.},

In this study, we extend this research to explore the evolution and spread of HPAIV within Europe during the 2005\textendash 2010 epidemic, using all available sequences of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene regions that were collected in Europe and Russia during the outbreak. We use discrete-trait phylodynamic models within a Bayesian statistical framework to explore the evolution of HPAIV. Our results indicate that the genetic diversity and effective population size of HPAIV peaked between mid-2005 and early 2006, followed by drastic decline in 2007, which coincides with the end of the epidemic in Europe. Our results also suggest that domestic birds were the most likely source of the spread of the virus from Russia into Europe. Additionally, estimates of viral dispersal routes indicate that Russia, Romania, and Germany were key epicenters of these outbreaks. Our study quantifies the dynamics of a major European HPAIV pandemic and substantiates the ability of phylodynamic models to improve molecular surveillance of novel AIVs.},

Almost simultaneously, a Bayesian model averaging approach was developed that avoids conditioning on a single model but averages over a set of relaxed clock models. This approach returns estimates of the posterior probability of each clock model through which one can estimate the Bayes factor in favor of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) clock model; however, this Bayes factor estimate may suffer when the posterior probability of the MAP model approaches 1. Here, we compare these two recent developments with the HME, stabilized/smoothed HME (sHME), and AICM, using both synthetic and empirical data. Our comparison shows reassuringly that MAP identification and its Bayes factor provide similar performance to PS and SS and that these approaches considerably outperform HME, sHME, and AICM in selecting the correct underlying clock model. We also illustrate the importance of using proper priors on a large set of empirical data sets.},

  abstract = {Marginal likelihood estimates to compare models using Bayes factors frequently accompany Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Approaches to estimate marginal likelihoods have garnered increased attention over the past decade. In particular, the introduction of path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) into Bayesian phylogenetics has tremendously improved the accuracy of model selection. These sampling techniques are now used to evaluate complex evolutionary and population genetic models on empirical data sets, but considerable computational demands hamper their widespread adoption. Further, when very diffuse, but proper priors are specified for model parameters, numerical issues complicate the exploration of the priors, a necessary step in marginal likelihood estimation using PS or SS. To avoid such instabilities, generalized SS (GSS) has recently been proposed, introducing the concept of ``working distributions'' to facilitate\textemdash or shorten\textemdash the integration process that underlies marginal likelihood estimation. However, the need to fix the tree topology currently limits GSS in a coalescent-based framework. Here, we extend GSS by relaxing the fixed underlying tree topology assumption. To this purpose, we introduce a ``working'' distribution on the space of genealogies, which enables estimating marginal likelihoods while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. We propose two different ``working'' distributions that help GSS to outperform PS and SS in terms of accuracy when comparing demographic and evolutionary models applied to synthetic data and real-world examples. Further, we show that the use of very diffuse priors can lead to a considerable overestimation in marginal likelihood when using PS and SS, while still retrieving the correct marginal likelihood using both GSS approaches. The methods used in this article are available in BEAST, a powerful user-friendly software package to perform Bayesian evolutionary analyses.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in marginal likelihood estimation for model selection in the field of Bayesian phylogenetics and molecular evolution have emphasized the poor performance of the harmonic mean estimator (HME). Although these studies have shown the merits of new approaches applied to standard normally distributed examples and small real-world data sets, not much is currently known concerning the performance and computational issues of these methods when fitting complex evolutionary and population genetic models to empirical real-world data sets. Further, these approaches have not yet seen widespread application in the field due to the lack of implementations of these computationally demanding techniques in commonly used phylogenetic packages. We here investigate the performance of some of these new marginal likelihood estimators, specifically, path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone (SS) sampling for comparing models of demographic change and relaxed molecular clocks, using synthetic data and real-world examples for which unexpected inferences were made using the HME. Given the drastically increased computational demands of PS and SS sampling, we also investigate a posterior simulation-based analogue of Akaike's information criterion (AIC) through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a model comparison approach that shares with the HME the appealing feature of having a low computational overhead over the original MCMC analysis. We confirm that the HME systematically overestimates the marginal likelihood and fails to yield reliable model classification and show that the AICM performs better and may be a useful initial evaluation of model choice but that it is also, to a lesser degree, unreliable. We show that PS and SS sampling substantially outperform these estimators and adjust the conclusions made concerning previous analyses for the three real-world data sets that we reanalyzed.

We earlier found most HIV-1 transmissions to occur within FCs of Lake Victoria. Here, we test the hypothesis that HIV-1 transmission in FCs is isolated from networks in the GP. We used phylogeography to reconstruct the geospatial viral migration patterns in 8 FCs and 2 GP cohorts and a Bayesian phylogenetic inference in BEAST v1.8.4 to analyse the temporal dynamics of HIV-1 transmission. Subtype A1 (pol region) was most prevalent in the FCs (115, 45.1\%) and GP (177, 50.4\%). More recent HIV transmission pairs from FCs were found at a genetic distance (GD) {$<$}1.5\% than in the GP (Fisher's exact test, p\,=\,0.001). The mean time depth for pairs was shorter in FCs (5 months) than in the GP (4 years). Phylogeographic analysis showed strong support for viral migration from the GP to FCs without evidence of substantial viral dissemination to the GP. This suggests that FCs are a sink for, not a source of, virus strains from the GP. Targeted interventions in FCs should be extended to include the neighbouring GP for effective epidemic control.},

  abstract = {Rabies is a progressively fatal and incurable viral encephalitis caused by a lyssavirus infection. Almost all of the 55 000 annual rabies deaths in humans result from infection with dog rabies viruses (RABV). Despite the importance of rabies for human health, little is known about the spread of RABV in dog populations, and patterns of biodiversity have only been studied in limited geographical space. To address these questions on a global scale, we sequenced 62 new isolates and performed an extensive comparative analysis of RABV gene sequence data, representing 192 isolates sampled from 55 countries. From this, we identified six clades of RABV in non-flying mammals, each of which has a distinct geographical distribution, most likely reflecting major physical barriers to gene flow. Indeed, a detailed analysis of phylogeographic structure revealed only limited viral movement among geographical localities. Using Bayesian coalescent methods we also reveal that the sampled lineages of canid RABV derive from a common ancestor that originated within the past 1500 years. Additionally, we found no evidence for either positive selection or widespread population bottlenecks during the global expansion of canid RABV. Overall, our study reveals that the stochastic processes of genetic drift and population subdivision are the most important factors shaping the global phylogeography of canid RABV.},

  abstract = {The Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance is a well-established measure between phylogenetic trees. Despite a lack of biological justification, it has the advantages of being a proper metric and being computable in linear time. For phylogenetic applications involving genes, however, a crucial aspect of the trees ignored by the RF metric is the type of the branching event (e.g. speciation, duplication, transfer, etc).Here, we extend RF to trees with labeled internal nodes by including a node flip operation, alongside edge contractions and extensions. We explore properties of this extended RF distance in the case of a binary labeling. In particular, we show that contrary to the unlabeled case, an optimal edit path may require contracting ``good'' edges, i.e. edges shared between the two trees. We provide a 2-approximation algorithm which is shown to perform well empirically. Looking ahead, computing distances between labeled trees opens up a variety of new algorithmic directions. Implementation and simulations available at https://github.com/DessimozLab/pylabeledrf.},

We developed informative, base-by-base error predictors for this sequencer and used a variant of the phred binning algorithm to combine them into a single empirically derived quality score. These quality scores are more useful than those produced by the system software: They both better predict actual error rates and identify many more high-quality bases. We developed a SNP detection method, with variants for low coverage, high coverage, and PCR amplicon applications, and evaluated it on known-truth data sets. We demonstrate good specificity in single reads, and excellent specificity (no false positives in 215 kb of genome) in high-coverage data.},

Subtype 1f is endemic in a restricted geographic area, meaning that it has local distribution. We investigated the population dynamics of BVDV-1f in Northern Italy and characterized the transmission chains of a subset of samples from Piedmont and Aosta Valley regions. A total of 51 samples from 1966 to 2013 were considered and 5{${'}$} UTR sequences were used for phylogeography. A subset of 12 samples was selected for Npro gene sequencing and further characterization of the transmission chains using both molecular and epidemiological data. Phylogeography estimated the root of BVDV-1f tree in Veneto in 1965. Four significant subclades included sequences clustering by region: Lombardy (n=3), Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna (n=7), Piedmont (n=17), Piedmont and Aosta Valley (n=21). The Piedmont-only subclade has a ladder-like branching structure, while the Piedmont and Aosta Valley subclade has a nearly complete binary structure. In the subset, the outbreak reconstruction identified one sample from Piedmont as the most probable source of infection for the Aosta Valley cases. An ad hoc questionnaire submitted to public veterinarians revealed connections between sampled and non-sampled farms by means of trades, exhibitions and markets. According to the phylogeography, BVDV-1f moved westward, entering from Veneto, and spreading to Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna in the early 1990s, and finally to Piedmont and Aosta Valley in the first decade of 2000s. Both phylogeographic analyses on the whole dataset and on the selection of Npro dataset pointed out that subtype 1f entered Aosta Valley from Piedmont. The integration of molecular and epidemiological data revealed connections between farms, and such approach should be considered in any control plan. In Aosta Valley, the study showed that BVDV1f can be controlled only monitoring the introduction of cattle from Piedmont region.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. Understanding HIV dynamics across the human body is important for cure efforts. This goal has been hampered by technical difficulties and the challenge of obtaining fresh tissues. METHODS. This observational study evaluated 6 individuals with HIV (n = 4 with viral suppression using antiretroviral [ART] therapy; n = 2 with rebound viremia after stopping ART), who provided serial blood samples before death and their bodies for rapid autopsy. HIV reservoirs were characterized by digital droplet PCR, single-genome amplification, and sequencing of fulllength (FL) envelope HIV. Phylogeographic methods were used to reconstruct HIV spread, and generalized linear models were tested for viral factors associated with dispersal. RESULTS. Across participants, HIV DNA levels varied from approximately 0 to 659 copies/106 cells (IQR: 22.9\textendash 126.5). A total of 605 intact FL env sequences were recovered in antemortem blood cells and across 28 tissues (IQR: 5\textendash 9). Sequence analysis showed (a) the emergence of large, identical, intact HIV RNA populations in blood after cessation of therapy, which repopulated tissues throughout the body; (b) that multiple sites acted as hubs for HIV dissemination but that blood and lymphoid tissues were the main source; (c) that viral exchanges occurred within brain areas and across the blood-brain barrier; and (d) that migration was associated with low HIV divergence between sites and greater diversity at the recipient site. CONCLUSION. HIV reservoirs persisted in all deep tissues, and blood was the main source of dispersal. This may explain why eliminating HIV susceptibility in circulating T cells via bone marrow transplants allowed some individuals with HIV to experience therapy-free remission, even though deeper tissue reservoirs were not targeted.},

  abstract = {Genetic clustering is a popular method for characterizing variation in transmission rates for rapidly evolving viruses, and could potentially be used to detect outbreaks in `near real time'. However, the statistical properties of clustering are poorly understood in this context, and there are no objective guidelines for setting clustering criteria. Here, we develop a new statistical framework to optimize a genetic clustering method based on the ability to forecast new cases. We analysed the pairwise Tamura-Nei (TN93) genetic distances for anonymized HIV-1 subtype B pol sequences from Seattle (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1,653) and Middle Tennessee, USA (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2,779), and northern Alberta, Canada (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 809). Under varying TN93 thresholds, we fit two models to the distributions of new cases relative to clusters of known cases: 1, a null model that assumes cluster growth is strictly proportional to cluster size, i.e. no variation in transmission rates among individuals; and 2, a weighted model that incorporates individual-level covariates, such as recency of diagnosis. The optimal threshold maximizes the difference in information loss between models, where covariates are used most effectively. Optimal TN93 thresholds varied substantially between data sets, e.g. 0.0104 in Alberta and 0.016 in Seattle and Tennessee, such that the optimum for one population would potentially misdirect prevention efforts in another. For a given population, the range of thresholds where the weighted model conferred greater predictive accuracy tended to be narrow (60.005 units), and the optimal threshold tended to be stable over time. Our framework also indicated that variation in the recency of HIV diagnosis among clusters was significantly more predictive of new cases than sample collection dates (DAIC {$>$} 50). These results suggest that one cannot rely on historical precedence or convention to configure genetic clustering methods for public health applications, especially when translating methods between settings of low-level and generalized epidemics. Our framework not only enables investigators to calibrate a clustering method to a specific public health setting, but also provides a variable selection procedure to evaluate different predictive models of cluster growth.},

  abstract = {Genome and exome sequencing yield extensive catalogues of genetic variation in many individuals, but purely genetic approaches are often insufficiently powered to specifically identify the few variants that are causally related to any given phenotype. Indeed, variant interpretation is an increasingly important challenge at the interface of genetics, statistics and biology.Non-uniform estimates of the prior probability for variants to be biologically functional will be required to address this challenge. For disease studies, this can be translated into the need to estimate variant deleteriousness.Nearly all computational methods to predict deleteriousness use comparative sequence analysis, exploiting the fact that natural selection removes deleterious variants and tends to conserve the identities of important positions within genes and genomes.Assessment of protein-altering variants leverages both biochemical and evolutionary information, whereas non-coding variation is more challenging to study, given a lack of understanding of the molecular functionality of non-coding sequences relative to coding sequences.Experimental assessments of the functional impact of variants have historically relied on low-throughput assays. However, projects such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the clever use of next-generation sequencing technologies are increasingly facilitating large-scale, systematic experimental assessment of genomic variation of many types.Ultimately, unified predictive methods that are applicable to both coding and non-coding variants that leverage both functional and evolutionary information will be crucial for the meaningful interpretation of personal genomes. However, important unknowns and unsolved phenomena, including the relative abundance and penetrance of coding versus non-coding variants, disagreements between evolutionary and experimental definitions of molecular functionality, and the vocabularies that define transcriptional regulatory elements, must first be addressed.},

In Ecuador, FMDV is maintained at an endemic state, with sporadic outbreaks. To unravel the tempo and mode of FMDV spread within the country we conducted a Bayesian phylogeographic analysis using a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) to model the diffusion of FMDV between Ecuadorian provinces. We implement this framework through Markov chain Monte Carlo available in the BEAST package to study 90 FMDV serotype O isolates from 17 provinces in the period 2002\textendash 2010. The Bayesian approach also allowed us to test hypotheses on the mechanisms of viral spread by incorporating environmental and epidemiological data in our prior distributions and perform Bayesian model selection. Our analyses suggest an intense flow of viral strains throughout the country that is possibly coupled to animal movements and ecological factors, since most of inferred viral spread routes were in Coast and Highland regions. Moreover, our results suggest that both short- and long-range spread occur within Ecuador. The province of Esmeraldas, in the border with Colombia and where most animal commerce is done, was found to be the most probable origin of the circulating strains, pointing to a transboundary behavior of FMDV in South America. These findings suggest that uncontrolled animal movements can create a favorable environment for FMDV maintenance and pose a serious threat to control programmes. Also, we show that phylogeographic modeling can be a powerful tool in unraveling the spatial dynamics of viruses and potentially in controlling the spread of these pathogens.},

We apply an analytical workflow to a comprehensive WNV genome collection to test the impact of environmental factors on the dispersal of viral lineages and on viral population genetic diversity through time. We find that WNV lineages tend to disperse faster in areas with higher temperatures and we identify temporal variation in temperature as a main predictor of viral genetic diversity through time. By contrasting inference with simulation, we find no evidence for viral lineages to preferentially circulate within the same migratory bird flyway, suggesting a substantial role for non-migratory birds or mosquito dispersal along the longitudinal gradient.},

Science, this issue p. 582 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, with {$>$}365,000 cases in California as of 17 July 2020. We investigated the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California from late January to mid-March 2020, using samples from 36 patients spanning nine counties and the Grand Princess cruise ship. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the cryptic introduction of at least seven different SARS-CoV-2 lineages into California, including epidemic WA1 strains associated with Washington state, with lack of a predominant lineage and limited transmission among communities. Lineages associated with outbreak clusters in two counties were defined by a single base substitution in the viral genome. These findings support contact tracing, social distancing, and travel restrictions to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in California and other states. The unfolding COVID-19 epidemic in Northern California appears to have resulted from multiple introductions of different lineages of the virus.

We define a phylogenetic likelihood, summarize how to compute this likelihood, and then discuss approaches used to maximize the phylogenetic likelihood function. We discuss a property of the maximum likelihood estimation, called consistency, that states that the maximum likelihood phylogeny will converge to the true phylogenetic tree with as more and more data are added to the analysis. We describe the bootstrap, a popular technique used to characterize the uncertainty in parameter estimates, and then outline its use in phylogenetic maximum likelihood estimation. A short example is given to illustrate the use of phylogenetic maximum likelihood techniques on a real dataset of primate mitochondrial DNA sequences.},

Lack of a comprehensive assessment of phylogeographical variation of the host has precluded the possibility of predicting spatial limits of existing strains of these viruses or geographical regions where novel viral strains might emerge. The complete cytochrome b gene was sequenced for 206 deer mice collected from sites throughout North America to provide a foundation for future studies of spatial structure and evolution of this ubiquitous host. Bayesian analyses of these sequences partitioned deer mice into six largely allopatric lineages, some of which may represent unrecognized species. The geographical distributions of these lineages were probably shaped by Quaternary climatic events. Populations of mice were apparently restricted to refugia during glacial advances, where they experienced genetic divergence. Expansion of these populations, following climatic amelioration, brought genetically distinctive forms into contact. Occurrence of parallel changes in virus strains can now be explored in appropriate regions. In New Mexico, for example, near the location where Sin Nombre virus was first discovered, there are three genetically distinctive lineages of deer mice whose geographical ranges need to be delineated precisely. The phylogeography of P. maniculatus provides a framework for interpreting geographical variability, not only in hosts, but also in associated viral variants and disease transmission, and an opportunity to predict the potential geographical distribution of newly emerging viral strains.,},

We present a new method for relaxing the assumption of a strict molecular clock using Markov chain Monte Carlo to implement Bayesian modeling averaging over random local molecular clocks. The new method approaches the problem of rate variation among lineages by proposing a series of local molecular clocks, each extending over a subregion of the full phylogeny. Each branch in a phylogeny (subtending a clade) is a possible location for a change of rate from one local clock to a new one. Thus, including both the global molecular clock and the unconstrained model results, there are a total of 22n-2 possible rate models available for averaging with 1, 2, ..., 2n - 2 different rate categories.},

  abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of ``relaxed phylogenetics.'' Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.},

  abstract = {Lassa virus is genetically diverse with several lineages circulating in West Africa. This study aimed at describing the sequence variability of Lassa virus across Nigeria and inferring its spatiotemporal evolution. We sequenced and isolated 77 Lassa virus strains from 16 Nigerian states. The final data set, including previous works, comprised metadata and sequences of 219 unique strains sampled between 1969 and 2018 in 22 states. Most of this data originated from Lassa fever patients diagnosed at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Edo State, Nigeria. The majority of sequences clustered with the main Nigerian lineages II and III, while a few sequences formed a new cluster related to Lassa virus strains from Hylomyscus pamfi. Within lineages II and III, seven and five sublineages, respectively, were distinguishable. Phylogeographic analysis suggests an origin of lineage II in the southeastern part of the country around Ebonyi State and a main vector of dispersal toward the west across the Niger River, through Anambra, Kogi, Delta, and Edo into Ondo State. The frontline of virus dispersal appears to be in Ondo. Minor vectors are directed northeast toward Taraba and Adamawa and south toward Imo and Rivers. Lineage III might have spread from northern Plateau State into Kaduna, Nasarawa, Federal Capital Territory, and Bauchi. One sublineage moved south and crossed the Benue River into Benue State. This study provides a geographic mapping of lineages and phylogenetic clusters in Nigeria at a higher resolution. In addition, we estimated the direction and time frame of virus dispersal in the country. IMPORTANCE Lassa virus is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever with a case fatality rate of approximately 30\% in Africa. Previous studies disclosed a geographical pattern in the distribution of Lassa virus strains and a westward movement of the virus across West Africa during evolution. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the geography of genetic lineages and sublineages of the virus in Nigeria. In addition, we modeled how the virus spread in the country. This knowledge allows us to predict into which geographical areas the virus might spread in the future and prioritize areas for Lassa fever surveillance. Our study not only aimed to generate Lassa virus sequences from across Nigeria but also to isolate and conserve the respective viruses for future research. Both isolates and sequences are important for the development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to treat and prevent Lassa fever, such as diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.},

  abstract = {The authors consider Bayesian analysis for continuous-time Markov chain models based on a conditional reference prior. For such models, inference of the elapsed time between chain observations depends heavily on the rate of decay of the prior as the elapsed time increases. Moreover, improper priors on the elapsed time may lead to improper posterior distributions. In addition, an infinitesimal rate matrix also characterizes this class of models. Experts often have good prior knowledge about the parameters of this matrix. The authors show that the use of a proper prior for the rate matrix parameters together with the conditional reference prior for the elapsed time yields a proper posterior distribution. The authors also demonstrate that, when compared to analyses based on priors previously proposed in the literature, a Bayesian analysis on the elapsed time based on the conditional reference prior possesses better frequentist properties. The type of prior thus represents a better default prior choice for estimation software. Les auteurs s'int\'eressent \`a l'emploi d'une loi a priori de r\'ef\'erence conditionnelle dans l'analyse bay\'esienne des mod\`eles de cha\^ines de Markov en temps continu. Dans ce cadre, l'inf\'erence sur le temps \'ecoul\'e entre les observations de la cha\^ine d\'epend fortement du taux de d\'egradation de la loi a priori au fil du temps. De plus, une loi a priori impropre sur le temps \'ecoul\'e peut conduire \`a une loi a posteriori impropre. Par ailleurs, ce type de mod\`ele est aussi caract\'eris\'e par une matrice de taux infinit\'esimaux. Les experts ont souvent une bonne connaissance a priori des param\`etres de cette matrice. Les auteurs montrent que l'emploi d'une loi a priori integrable pour les param\`etres de la matrice et d'une loi a priori de r\'ef\'erence conditionnelle pour le temps \'ecoul\'e conduit \`a une loi a posteriori integrable.

Achieving dramatically reduced cost with enhanced throughput and quality will require the seamless integration of scientific and technological effort across disciplines within biochemistry, chemistry, physics and engineering. The challenges include sample preparation, surface chemistry, fluorescent labels, optimizing the enzyme-substrate system, optics, instrumentation, understanding tradeoffs of throughput versus accuracy, and read-length/phasing limitations.

However, the use of these sequencing technologies is often challenged by errors and biases associated with the bioinformatical methods used for analyzing the data. In particular, the use of na\"ive methods to identify polymorphic sites and infer genotypes can inflate downstream analyses. Recently, explicit modeling of genotype probability distributions has been proposed as a method for taking genotype call uncertainty into account. Based on this idea, we propose a novel method for quantifying population genetic differentiation from next-generation sequencing data. In addition, we present a strategy for investigating population structure via principal components analysis. Through extensive simulations, we compare the new method herein proposed to approaches based on genotype calling and demonstrate a marked improvement in estimation accuracy for a wide range of conditions. We apply the method to a large-scale genomic data set of domesticated and wild silkworms sequenced at low coverage. We find that we can infer the fine-scale genetic structure of the sampled individuals, suggesting that employing this new method is useful for investigating the genetic relationships of populations sampled at low coverage.},

To infer past population dynamics from molecular sequence data, coalescent-based models have been developed for Bayesian nonparametric estimation of effective population size over time. Among the most successful is a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) model for a single gene locus. Here, we present a generalization of the GMRF model that allows for the analysis of multilocus sequence data. Using simulated data, we demonstrate the improved performance of our method to recover true population trajectories and the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). We analyze a multilocus alignment of HIV-1 CRF02\_AG gene sequences sampled from Cameroon. Our results are consistent with HIV prevalence data and uncover some aspects of the population history that go undetected in Bayesian parametric estimation. Finally, we recover an older and more reconcilable TMRCA for a classic ancient DNA data set.},

Then we address the problem of solving NMF, which is NP-hard in general.

  abstract = {Effective population size characterizes the genetic variability in a population and is a parameter of paramount importance in population genetics and evolutionary biology. Kingman's coalescent process enables inference of past population dynamics directly from molecular sequence data, and researchers have developed a number of flexible coalescent-based models for Bayesian nonparametric estimation of the effective population size as a function of time. Major goals of demographic reconstruction include identifying driving factors of effective population size, and understanding the association between the effective population size and such factors. Building upon Bayesian nonparametric coalescent-based approaches, we introduce a flexible framework that incorporates time-varying covariates that exploit Gaussian Markov random fields to achieve temporal smoothing of effective population size trajectories. To approximate the posterior distribution, we adapt efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian models. Incorporating covariates into the demographic inference framework enables the modeling of associations between the effective population size and covariates while accounting for uncertainty in population histories. Furthermore, it can lead to more precise estimates of population dynamics. We apply our model to four examples. We reconstruct the demographic history of raccoon rabies in North America and find a significant association with the spatiotemporal spread of the outbreak. Next, we examine the effective population size trajectory of the DENV-4 virus in Puerto Rico along with viral isolate count data and find similar cyclic patterns. We compare the population history of the HIV-1 CRF02\_AG clade in Cameroon with HIV incidence and prevalence data and find that the effective population size is more reflective of incidence rate. Finally, we explore the hypothesis that the population dynamics of musk ox during the Late Quaternary period were related to climate change.

  abstract = {The demography of populations and natural selection shape genetic variation across the genome and understanding the genomic consequences of these evolutionary processes is a fundamental aim of population genetics. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to quantify genome-wide population structure and identify candidate genetic regions affected by selection. This model improves on existing methods by accounting for stochastic sampling of sequences inherent in next-generation sequencing (with pooled or indexed individual samples) and by incorporating genetic distances among haplotypes in measures of genetic differentiation. Using simulations we demonstrate that this model has a low false-positive rate for classifying neutral genetic regions as selected genes (i.e., {$\phi$}ST outliers), but can detect recent selective sweeps, particularly when genetic regions in multiple populations are affected by selection. Nonetheless, selection affecting just a single population was difficult to detect and resulted in a high false-negative rate under certain conditions. We applied the Bayesian model to two large sets of human population genetic data. We found evidence of widespread positive and balancing selection among worldwide human populations, including many genetic regions previously thought to be under selection. Additionally, we identified novel candidate genes for selection, several of which have been linked to human diseases. This model will facilitate the population genetic analysis of a wide range of organisms on the basis of next-generation sequence data.},

There are C + f machines in the system, where C is the cap on the number of machines that can be turned on simultaneously (and hence, be at risk of failure), and the excess f machines comprise a maintenance float which can be used to replace machines that are taken down for repair. The server's behavior is dynamic, capable of switching queues upon a machine failure or service completion depending on both queue lengths. This generalized server behavior permits the analysis of several classic service policies, including preemptive resume priority, non-preemptive priority, and exhaustive. More complicated polices can also be considered, such as thresholdbased ones and a version of the Bernoulli service rule. The system is modeled as a level-dependent quasi-birth-and-death process and matrix analytic methods are used to find the steady-state joint queue length distribution, as well as the distribution for the sojourn time of a broken machine. An upper bound on the expected number of working machines as a function of C is derived, and Little's Law is used to find the relationship between the expected number of working machines and the expected sojourn time of a failed machine when f = 0 or f {$\geq$} 1. Several numerical examples are presented, including how one might optimize an objective function depending on the mean number of working machines, with penalty costs attributed to increasing C or f .},

  abstract = {Das Konzept der Evolution ist in der modernen Biologie von zentraler Bedeutung.  Deswegen liefert die Phylogenetik, die Lehre \"uber die Verwandschaften und Abstam-  mung von Organismen bzw. Spezies, entscheidende Hinweise zur Entschl\"usselung  einer Vielzahl biologischer Prozesse. Phylogenetische Stammb\"aume sind einerseits  f\"ur die Grundlagenforschung wichtig, da sie in Studien \"uber die Diversifizierung und  Umweltanpassung einzelner Organismengruppen (z.B. Insekten oder V\"ogel) bis hin  zu der gro\ss en Herausforderung, die Entstehung und Entwicklung aller Lebensfor-  men in einem umfassenden evolution\"aren Baum darzustellen (der sog. Tree of Life)  Anwendung finden. Andererseits werden phylogenetische Methoden auch in prax-  isnahen Anwendungen eingesetzt, um beispielsweise die Verbreitungsdynamik von  HIV-Infektionen oder, die Heterogenit\"at der Krebszellen eines Tumors, zu verstehen.  Den aktuellen Stand der Technik in der Stammbaumrekonstruktion stellen Meth-  oden Maximum Likelihood (ML) und Bayes'sche Inferenz (BI) dar, welche auf der  Analyse molekularer Sequenzendaten (DNA und Proteine) anhand probabilistis-  cher Evolutionsmodelle basieren. Diese Methoden weisen eine hohe Laufzeitkom-  plexit\"at auf (N P -schwer), welche die Entwicklung effizienter Heuristiken unabding-  bar macht. Hinzu kommt, dass die Berechnung der Zielfunktion (sog. Phylogenetic  Likelihood Function, PLF) neben einem hohen Speicherverbrauch auch eine Vielzahl  an Gleitkommaarithmetik-Operationen erfordert und somit extrem rechenaufwendig  ist.  Die neuesten Entwicklungen im Bereich der DNA-Sequenzierung (Next Gener-  ation Sequencing, NGS) steigern kontinuierlich den Durchsatz und senken zugleich  die Sequenzierungskosten um ein Vielfaches. F\"ur die Phylogenetik hat dies zur  Folge, dass die Dimensionen der zu analysierenden Datens\"atze alle 2\textendash 3 Jahre, um  eine Gr\"ossenordnung zunhemen. War es bisher \"ublich, einige Dutzend bis Hun-  derte Spezies anhand einzelner bzw. weniger Gene zu analysieren (Sequenzl\"ange:  1\textendash 10 Kilobasen), stellen derzeit Studien mit Tausenden Sequenzen oder Genen keine  Seltenheit mehr dar. In den n\"achsten 1\textendash 2 Jahren ist zu erwarten, dass die Anal-  ysen Tausender bis Zehntausender vollst\"andiger Genome bzw. Transkriptome (Se-  quenzl\"ange: 1\textendash 100 Megabasen und mehr) anstehen. Um diesen Aufgaben gewachsen  zu sein, m\"ussen die bestehenden Methoden weiterentwickelt und optimiert werden,  um vor allem H\"ochstleistungsrechner sowie neue Hardware-Architekturen optimal  nutzen zu k\"onnen.  Au\ss erdem f\"uhrt die sich beschleunigende Speicherung von Sequenzen in \"offentli-  chen Datenbanken wie NCBI GenBank (und ihren Derivaten) dazu, dass eine hohe  Qualit\"at der Sequenzannotierungen (z. B. Organismus- bzw. Speziesname, tax-  onomische Klassifikation, Name eines Gens usw.) nicht zwangsl\"aufig gew\"ahrleistet  ist. Das h\"angt unter anderem auch damit zusammen, dass eine zeitnahe Korrektur  durch entsprechende Experten nicht mehr m\"oglich ist, solange ihnen keine ad\"aquaten  Software-Tools zur Verf\"ugung stehen.  In dieser Doktroarbeit leisten wir mehrere Beitr\"age zur Bew\"altigung der oben  genannten Herausforderungen.  Erstens haben wir ExaML, eine dedizierte Software zur ML-basierten Stamm-  baumrekonstruktion f\"ur H\"ochstleistungsrechner, auf den Intel Xeon Phi Hardware-  beschleuniger portiert. Der Xeon Phi bietet im Vergleich zu klassischen x86 CPUs  eine h\"ohere Rechenleistung, die allerdings nur anhand architekturspezifischer Op-  timierungen vollst\"andig genutzt werden kann. Aus diesem Grund haben wir zum  einen die PLF-Berechnung f\"ur die 512-bit-Vektoreinheit des Xeon Phi umstrukturi-  ert und optimiert. Zum anderen haben wir die in ExaML bereits vorhandene reine  MPI-Parallelisierung durch eine hybride MPI/OpenMP-L\"osung ersetzt. Diese hy-  bride L\"osung weist eine wesentlich bessere Skalierbarkeit f\"ur eine hohe Zahl von  Kernen bzw. Threads innerhalb eines Rechenknotens auf (\&gt;100 HW-Threads f\"ur  Xeon Phi).  Des Weiteren haben wir eine neue Software zur ML-Baumrekonstruktion na-  mens RAxML-NG entwickelt. Diese implementiert, bis auf kleinere Anpassungen, zwar  denselben Suchalgorithmus wie das weit verbreitete Programm RAxML, bietet aber  gegen\"uber RAxML mehrere Vorteile: (a) dank den sorgf\"altigen Optimierungen der  PLF-Berechnung ist es gelungen, die Laufzeiten um den Faktor 2 bis 3 zu reduzieren  (b) die Skalierbarkeit auf extrem gro\ss en Eingabedatens\"atzen wurde verbessert, in-  dem ineffiziente topologische Operationen eliminiert bzw. optimiert wurden, (c) die  bisher nur in ExaML verf\"ugbaren, f\"ur gro\ss e Datens\"atze relevanten Funktionen wie  Checkpointing sowie ein dedizierter Datenverteilungsalgorithmus wurden nachimple-  mentiert (d) dem Benutzer steht eine gr\"o\ss ere Auswahl an statistischen DNA-Evo-  lutionsmodellen zur Verf\"ugung, die zudem flexibler kombiniert und parametrisiert  werden k\"onnen (e) die Weiterentwicklung der Software wird aufgrund der modularen  Architektur wesentlich erleichtert (die Funktionen zur PLF-Berechnung wurden in  eine gesonderte Bibliothek ausgeglidert).  Als n\"achstes haben wir untersucht, wie sich Sequenzierungsfehler auf die Genau-  igkeit phylogenetischr Stammbaumrekonstruktionen auswirken. Wir modifizieren  den RAxML bzw. RAxML-NG Code dahingehend, dass sowohl die explizite Angabe von  Fehlerwahrscheinlichkeiten als auch die automatische Sch\"atzung von Fehlerraten  mittels der ML-Methode m\"oglich ist. Unsere Simulationen zeigen: (a) Wenn die  Fehler gleichverteilt sind, kann die Fehlerrate direkt aus den Sequenzdaten gesch\"atzt  werden. (b) Ab einer Fehlerrate von ca. 1\% liefert die Baumrekonstruktion unter  Ber\"ucksichtigung des Fehlermodells genauere Ergebnisse als die klassische Methode,  welche die Eingabe als fehlerfrei annimmt.  Ein weiterer Beitrag im Rahmen dieser Arbeit ist die Software-Pipeline SATIVA  zur rechnergest\"utzten Identifizierung und Korrektur fehlerhafter taxonomischer An-  notierungen in gro\ss en Sequenzendatenbanken. Der Algorithmus funktioniert wie  folgt: f\"ur jede Sequenz wird die Platzierung im Stammbaum mit dem h\"ochst-  m\"oglichen Likelihood-Wert ermittelt und anschlie\ss end gepr\"uft, ob diese mit der  vorgegeben taxonomischen Klassifikation \"ubereinstimmt. Ist dies nicht der Fall,  wird also eine Sequenz beispielsweise innerhalb einer anderen Gattung platziert,  wird die Sequenz als falsch annotiert gemeldet, und es wird eine entsprechende  Umklassifizierung vorgeschlagen. Auf simulierten Datens\"atzen mit zuf\"allig eingef\"ug-  ten Fehlern, erreichte unsere Pipeline eine hohe Identifikationsquote (\&gt;90\%) sowie  Genauigkeit (\&gt;95\%). Zur Evaluierung anhand empirischer Daten, haben wir vier  \"offentliche rRNA Datenbanken untersucht, welche zur Klassifizierung von Bakterien  h\"aufig als Referenz benutzt werden. Dabei haben wir je nach Datenbank 0.2\% bis  2.5\% aller Sequenzen als potenzielle Fehlannotierungen identifiziert.},

We provide an update to the Californian GMPE model of Abrahamson et al. (2014) that explicitly accounts for path effects in California by replacing the anelastic attenuation coefficient with a regionally varying one. The updated attenuation model is based on the approach of Dawood and Rodriguez-Marek (2013). Accounting for path effects leads to a smaller value of the aleatory variability, and results in different median predictions, depending on source and site location. The model is cast as a Bayesian hierarchical model, which allows one to capture the epistemic uncertainties in the anelastic attenuation coefficients. We show that it is important to account for the uncertainty in the attenuation coefficients when using the model for prediction. The differences in attenuation decrease with increasing spectral period. The updated attenuation model is developed with respect to the GMPE of Abrahamson et al. (2014) but can be easily extended for other models and other regions as well.},

Evaluations of ground-motion data sets with multiple measurements at a given site and multiple earthquakes in a given region have shown that the ergodic assumption is not appropriate as there are strong systematic region-specific source terms and site-specific path and site terms that are spatially correlated. We model these correlations using a spatial Gaussian process model. Different correlations functions are employed, both stationary and nonstationary, and the results are compared in terms of their predictive power. Spatial correlations of residuals are investigated on a Taiwanese strong-motion data set, and ground motions are collected at the ANZA, CA array. Source effects are spatially correlated, but provide a much stronger benefit in terms of prediction for the ANZA data set than for the Taiwanese data set. We find that systematic path effects are best modeled by a non-stationary covariance function that is dependent on source-to-site distance and magnitude. The correlation structure estimated from Californian data can be transferred to Taiwan if one carefully accounts for differences in magnitudes. About 50\% of aleatory variance can be explained by accounting for spatial correlation.},

With a large increase in the number of recorded ground-motion data, there are now repeated observations at given sites and from multiple earthquakes in small regions, so that assumption can be relaxed. We use a novel approach to develop a nonergodic GMM, which is cast as a varying-coefficient model (VCM). In this model, the coefficients are allowed to vary by geographical location, which makes it possible to incorporate effects of spatially varying source, path, and site conditions. Hence, a separate set of coefficients is estimated for each source and site coordinate in the data set. The coefficients are constrained to be similar for spatially nearby locations. This is achieved by placing a Gaussian process prior on the coefficients. The amount of correlation is determined by the data. The spatial correlation structure of the model allows one to extrapolate the varying coefficients to a new location and trace the corresponding uncertainties. The approach is illustrated with the Next Generation Attenuation-West2 data set, using only Californian records. The VCM outperforms a traditionally estimated GMM in terms of generalization error and leads to a reduction in the aleatory standard deviation by {$\sim$}40\%, which has important implications for seismic-hazard calculations. The scaling of the model with respect to its predictor variables such as magnitude and distance is physically plausible. The epistemic uncertainty associated with the predicted ground motions is small in places where events or stations are close and large where data are sparse.},

Here, we present an approach to integrate individual travel history data in Bayesian phylogeographic inference and apply it to the early spread of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that including travel history data yields i) more realistic hypotheses of virus spread and ii) higher posterior predictive accuracy compared to including only sampling location. We further explore methods to ameliorate the impact of sampling bias by augmenting the phylogeographic analysis with lineages from undersampled locations. Our reconstructions reinforce specific transmission hypotheses suggested by the inclusion of travel history data, but also suggest alternative routes of virus migration that are plausible within the epidemiological context but are not apparent with current sampling efforts.},

  abstract = {As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.},

  abstract = {Information on global human movement patterns is central to spatial epidemiological models used to predict the behavior of influenza and other infectious diseases. Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone. Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza viruses, but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility, mainly because no statistical framework exists within which viral gene sequences and empirical data on host movement can be combined. Here, we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses worldwide. Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread, we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows, whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance. Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global influenza diversity. By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009, we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated. In conclusion, the global dynamics of influenza viruses are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled viral genomes. The integrated approach introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control., What explains the geographic dispersal of emerging pathogens? Reconstructions of evolutionary history from pathogen gene sequences offer qualitative descriptions of spatial spread, but current approaches are poorly equipped to formally test and quantify the contribution of different potential explanatory factors, such as human mobility and demography. Here, we use a novel phylogeographic method to evaluate multiple potential predictors of viral spread in human influenza dynamics. We identify air travel as the predominant driver of global influenza migration, whilst also revealing the contribution of other mobility processes at more local scales. We demonstrate the power of our inter-disciplinary approach by using it to predict the global pandemic expansion of H1N1 influenza in 2009. Our study highlights the importance of integrating evolutionary and ecological information when studying the dynamics of infectious disease.},

Ewing and Green defined Phred quality scores for base-calling from sequencing traces by training a model on a large amount of data. However, sample preparations and sequencing machines may work under different conditions in practice and therefore quality scores need to be adjusted. Moreover, the information given by quality scores is incomplete in the sense that they do not describe error patterns. We observe that each nucleotide base has its specific error pattern that varies across the range of quality values. We develop models of measurement error for shotgun sequencing by combining the two perspectives above. We propose a logistic model taking quality scores as covariates. The model is trained by a procedure combining an EM algorithm and model selection techniques. The training results in calibration of quality values and leads to a more accurate construction of consensus. Besides Phred scores obtained from ABI sequencers, we apply the same technique to calibrate quality values that come along with Beckman sequencers.},

However, some of these technologies produce very short reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and real data. MAQ is accurate, efficient, versatile, and user-friendly. It is freely available at http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.},

All of this information was integrated into a single quality score for each base under Bayesian theory to measure the accuracy of consensus calling. We tested this methodology using a large-scale human resequencing data set of 36\texttimes{} coverage and assembled a high-quality nonrepetitive consensus sequence for 92.25\% of the diploid autosomes and 88.07\% of the haploid X chromosome. Comparison of the consensus sequence with Illumina human 1M BeadChip genotyped alleles from the same DNA sample showed that 98.6\% of the 37,933 genotyped alleles on the X chromosome and 98\% of 999,981 genotyped alleles on autosomes were covered at 99.97\% and 99.84\% consistency, respectively. At a low sequencing depth, we used prior probability of dbSNP alleles and were able to improve coverage of the dbSNP sites significantly as compared to that obtained using a nonimputation model. Our analyses demonstrate that our method has a very low false call rate at any sequencing depth and excellent genome coverage at a high sequencing depth.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Most existing methods for DNA sequence analysis rely on accurate sequences or genotypes. However, in applications of the next-generation sequencing (NGS), accurate genotypes may not be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or somatic mutation discovery). These applications press for the development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with uncertainty.Results: We present a statistical framework for calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring population genetical parameters and performing association tests directly based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or linkage-based imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping. We also highlight the necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events, mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors.Availability:http://samtools.sourceforge.netContact:hengli@broadinstitute.org},

Limited availability of sequence data has hindered phylogeographic studies. The complete genomic sequence of all three segments of 14 Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus strains isolated from 1958\textendash 2000 in Russia, Central Asia and Africa was identified. Each genomic segment was independently subjected to continuous Bayesian phylogeographic analysis. The origin of each genomic segment was traced to Africa about 1,000\textendash 5,000 years ago. The virus was first introduced to South and Central Asia in the Middle Ages, and then spread to China, India and Russia. Reverse transfers of genomic segments from Asia to Africa were also observed. The European CCHFV genotype V was introduced to Europe via the Astrakhan region in South Russia 280\textendash 400 years ago and subsequently gradually spread westward in Russia, to Turkey and the Balkans less than 150 years ago. Only a few recombination events could be suggested in S and L genomic segments, while segment reassortment was very common. The median height of a non-reassortant phylogenetic tree node was 68\textendash 156 years. There were reassortment events within the European CCHFV lineage, but not with viruses from other locations. Therefore, CCHFV in Europe is a recently emerged zoonosis that represents a spillover from the global gene pool.},

We aimed to investigate the pathogen profiles in fatal cases, the circulation and transmission pattern of the viruses by combining metatranscriptomic, phylogenetic, and epidemiological analyses. Metatranscriptomic sequencing was used to characterize the enteroviruses. Clinical and environmental surveillance in the local population was performed to understand the prevalence and genetic diversity of the viruses in the local population. The possible source(s), evolution, transmission, and recombination of the viruses were investigated by incorporating genomes from the current outbreak, from local retrospective surveillance, and from public databases. Metatranscriptomic analysis identified Echovirus 11 (E11) in three fatal cases. Seroprevalence of neutralization antibody to E11 was 35 to 44 per cent in 3\textendash 15 age groups of general population, and the viruses were associated with various clinical symptoms. From the viral phylogeny, nosocomial transmissions were identified and all E11 2019 outbreak strains were closely related with E11 strains circulating in local population 2017\textendash 19. Frequent recombination occurred among the 2019 Guangdong E11 outbreak strains and various genotypes in enterovirus B species. This study provides an example of combining advanced genetic technology and epidemiological surveillance in pathogen diagnosis, source(s), and transmission tracing during an infectious disease outbreak. The result highlights the hidden E11 circulation and the risk of viral transmission and infection in the young age population in China. Frequent recombination between Guangdong-like strains and other enterovirus genotypes also implies the prevalence of these emerging E11 strains.},

  abstract = {Ancestral state reconstructions in Bayesian phylogeography of virus pandemics have been improved by utilizing a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) framework. Recently, this framework has been extended to model the transition rate matrix between discrete states as a generalized linear model (GLM) of genetic, geographic, demographic, and environmental predictors of interest to the virus and incorporating BSSVS to estimate the posterior inclusion probabilities of each predictor. Although the latter appears to enhance the biological validity of ancestral state reconstruction, there has yet to be a comparison of phylogenies created by the two methods. In this paper, we compare these two methods, while also using a primitive method without BSSVS, and highlight the differences in phylogenies created by each. We test six coalescent priors and six random sequence samples of H3N2 influenza during the 2014\textendash 15 flu season in the U.S. We show that the GLMs yield significantly greater root state posterior probabilities than the two alternative methods under five of the six priors, and significantly greater Kullback-Leibler divergence values than the two alternative methods under all priors. Furthermore, the GLMs strongly implicate temperature and precipitation as driving forces of this flu season and nearly unanimously identified a single root state, which exhibits the most tropical climate during a typical flu season in the U.S. The GLM, however, appears to be highly susceptible to sampling bias compared with the other methods, which casts doubt on whether its reconstructions should be favored over those created by alternate methods. We report that a BSSVS approach with a Poisson prior demonstrates less bias toward sample size under certain conditions than the GLMs or primitive models, and believe that the connection between reconstruction method and sampling bias warrants further investigation., For the better part of the last decade, epidemiological researchers have employed a Bayesian framework to reconstruct phylogenetic trees and determine the spatiotemporal relationships between clades of viruses. Recently, an extension of this framework has enabled direct assessment of how various demographic, geographic, genetic, and environmental variables play a role in these relationships, but there has yet to be a comparison between the former and the latter. Here, we aim to assess the differences between the two reconstruction techniques, as well as an additional primitive method, using the 2014\textendash 15 influenza season in the U.S. as a case study under a variety of population growth scenarios. We highlight how the new method demonstrates significant increases in commonly-reported trends in phylogenies and that the method identifies climate predictors that appear to be consistent with known trends in seasonal trends in influenza. However, we found that this method appears to be the most heavily influenced by the locations at which the viruses were obtained. Our work offers valuable insight for researchers wishing to study the evolutionary history of viruses and also may prove useful in determining the correct method to choose for a given application of virus phylogeography.},

  abstract = {Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases of zoonotic origin like highly pathogenic avian influenza pose a significant threat to human and animal health due to their elevated transmissibility. Identifying the drivers of such viruses is challenging and complicates the estimation of spatial diffusion because the variability of viral spread from locations could be caused by a complex array of unknown factors. Several techniques exist to help identify these drivers including bioinformatics, phylogeography, and spatial epidemiology but these methods are generally evaluated separately and do not consider the complementary nature of each other. Here we studied an approach that integrates these techniques and identifies the most important drivers of viral spread by focusing on H5N1 in Egypt because of its recent emergence as an epicenter for the disease. We used a Bayesian phylogeographic generalized linear model (GLM) to reconstruct spatiotemporal patterns of viral diffusion while simultaneously assessing the impact of factors contributing to transmission. We also calculated the cross-species transmission rates among hosts in order to identify the species driving transmission. Density of both human and avian species were supported contributors along with latitude, longitude, elevation, and several meteorological variables. Also supported was the presence of a genetic motif found near the hemagglutinin cleavage site. Various genetic, geographic, demographic, and environmental predictors each play a role in H1N1 diffusion. Further development and expansion of phylogeographic GLMs such as this will enable health agencies to identify variables that can curb virus diffusion and reduce morbidity and mortality.},

Here, we assess the contribution of filtering and dispersal limitation to the spatial aggregation patterns of 456 tree species in a hyperdiverse Amazonian forest and find distinct functional trait correlates of interspecific variation in these processes. Spatial point process model analysis revealed that both mechanisms are important drivers of intraspecific aggregation for the majority of species. Leaf drought tolerance was correlated with species topographic distributions in this aseasonal rainforest, showing that future increases in drought severity could significantly impact community structure. In addition, seed mass was associated with the spatial scale and density of dispersal-related aggregation. Taken together, these results suggest environmental filtering and dispersal limitation act in concert to influence the spatial and functional structure of diverse forest communities.},

  abstract = {Kingman's coalescent process opens the door for estimation of population genetics model parameters from molecular sequences. One paramount parameter of interest is the effective population size. Temporal variation of this quantity characterizes the demographic history of a population. Because researchers are rarely able to choose a priori a deterministic model describing effective population size dynamics for data at hand, nonparametric curve-fitting methods based on multiple change-point (MCP) models have been developed. We propose an alternative to change-point modeling that exploits Gaussian Markov random fields to achieve temporal smoothing of the effective population size in a Bayesian framework. The main advantage of our approach is that, in contrast to MCP models, the explicit temporal smoothing does not require strong prior decisions. To approximate the posterior distribution of the population dynamics, we use efficient, fast mixing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian models. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed temporal smoothing method, named Bayesian skyride, successfully recovers ``true'' population size trajectories in all simulation scenarios and competes well with the MCP approaches without evoking strong prior assumptions. We apply our Bayesian skyride method to 2 real data sets. We analyze sequences of hepatitis C virus contemporaneously sampled in Egypt, reproducing all key known aspects of the viral population dynamics. Next, we estimate the demographic histories of human influenza A hemagglutinin sequences, serially sampled throughout 3 flu seasons.},

We conclude that the virus was initially introduced from humans and has since evolved, most likely reflecting widespread circulation among mink in the beginning of the infection period several weeks prior to detection. Despite enhanced biosecurity, early warning surveillance and immediate culling of infected farms, transmission occurred between mink farms in three big transmission clusters with unknown modes of transmission. Sixty-eight percent (68\%) of the tested mink farm residents, employees and/or contacts had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Where whole genomes were available, these persons were infected with strains with an animal sequence signature, providing evidence of animal to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within mink farms.},

  abstract = {Changes in population size influence genetic diversity of the population and, as a result, leave a signature of these changes in individual genomes in the population. We are interested in the inverse problem of reconstructing past population dynamics from genomic data. We start with a standard framework based on the coalescent, a stochastic process that generates genealogies connecting randomly sampled individuals from the population of interest. These genealogies serve as a glue between the population demographic history and genomic sequences. It turns out that only the times of genealogical lineage coalescences contain information about population size dynamics. Viewing these coalescent times as a point process, estimating population size trajectories is equivalent to estimating a conditional intensity of this point process. Therefore, our inverse problem is similar to estimating an inhomogeneous Poisson process intensity function. We demonstrate how recent advances in Gaussian process-based nonparametric inference for Poisson processes can be extended to Bayesian nonparametric estimation of population size dynamics under the coalescent. We compare our Gaussian process (GP) approach to one of the state-of-the-art Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) methods for estimating population trajectories. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our method has better accuracy and precision. Next, we analyze two genealogies reconstructed from real sequences of hepatitis C and human Influenza A viruses. In both cases, we recover more believed aspects of the viral demographic histories than the GMRF approach. We also find that our GP method produces more reasonable uncertainty estimates than the GMRF method.},

Genetic clustering methods are becoming increasingly popular for molecular epidemiology, especially in the context of HIV where there is now considerable interest in applying these methods to prioritize groups for public health resources such as pre-exposure prophylaxis. To date, genetic clustering has generally been performed with ad hoc algorithms, only some of which have since been encoded and distributed as free software. These algorithms have seldom been validated on simulated data where clusters are known, and their interpretation and similarities are not transparent to users outside of the field. Here, I provide a brief overview on the development and inter-relationships of genetic clustering methods, and an evaluation of six methods on data simulated under an epidemic model in a risk-structured population. The simulation analysis demonstrates that the majority of clustering methods are systematically biased to detect variation in sampling rates among subpopulations, not variation in transmission rates. I discuss these results in the context of previous work and the implications for public health applications of genetic clustering.},

  abstract = {A phylogeny is a tree-based model of common ancestry that is an indispensable tool for studying biological variation. Phylogenies play a special role in the study of rapidly evolving populations such as viruses, where the proliferation of lineages is constantly being shaped by the mode of virus transmission, by adaptation to immune systems, and by patterns of human migration and contact. These processes may leave an imprint on the shapes of virus phylogenies that can be extracted for comparative study; however, tree shapes are intrinsically difficult to quantify. Here we present a comprehensive study of phylogenies reconstructed from 38 different RNA viruses from 12 taxonomic families that are associated with human pathologies. To accomplish this, we have developed a new procedure for studying phylogenetic tree shapes based on the `kernel trick', a technique that maps complex objects into a statistically convenient space. We show that our kernel method outperforms nine different tree balance statistics at correctly classifying phylogenies that were simulated under different evolutionary scenarios. Using the kernel method, we observe patterns in the distribution of RNA virus phylogenies in this space that reflect modes of transmission and pathogenesis. For example, viruses that can establish persistent chronic infections (such as HIV and hepatitis C virus) form a distinct cluster. Although the visibly `star-like' shape characteristic of trees from these viruses has been well-documented, we show that established methods for quantifying tree shape fail to distinguish these trees from those of other viruses. The kernel approach presented here potentially represents an important new tool for characterizing the evolution and epidemiology of RNA viruses.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}High-throughput sequencing technologies are used increasingly, not only in viral genomics research but also in clinical surveillance and diagnostics. These technologies facilitate the assessment of the genetic diversity in intra-host virus populations, which affects transmission, virulence, and pathogenesis of viral infections. However, there are two major challenges in analysing viral diversity. First, amplification and sequencing errors confound the identification of true biological variants, and second, the large data volumes represent computational limitations. To support viral high-throughput sequencing studies, we developed V-pipe, a bioinformatics pipeline combining various state-of-the-art statistical models and computational tools for automated end-to-end analyses of raw sequencing reads. V-pipe supports quality control, read mapping and alignment, low-frequency mutation calling, and inference of viral haplotypes. For generating high-quality read alignments, we developed a novel method, called \emph{ngshmmalign}, based on profile hidden Markov models and tailored to small and highly diverse viral genomes. V-pipe also includes benchmarking functionality providing a standardized environment for comparative evaluations of different pipeline configurations. We demonstrate this capability by assessing the impact of three different read aligners (Bowtie 2, BWA MEM, ngshmmalign) and two different variant callers (LoFreq, ShoRAH) on the performance of calling single-nucleotide variants in intra-host virus populations. V-pipe supports various pipeline configurations and is implemented in a modular fashion to facilitate adaptations to the continuously changing technology landscape.

The term phylodynamics has come to be associated with such studies.Phylodynamic questions arise in a number of practical contexts, including epidemic surveillance, outbreak control, forensics and clinical medicine.Evolutionary analysis methods can be applied to the investigation of viral dynamics at different organizational scales, from global studies of pathogen dissemination among continents, to the dynamics of infection within the tissues of individual infected hosts.Viral genomes are an important and independent source of information about epidemiological processes, thereby supporting and corroborating epidemiological results obtained using standard surveillance methods.The introduction of next-generation sequencing technologies will greatly increase the amount of viral genetic data available for analysis. Substantial changes and improvements to analysis methodologies will be necessary to deal with this exciting change.},

We apply this framework to the spread of the West Nile virus across North America, an important recent instance of spatial invasion by an emerging infectious disease. We demonstrate that the dispersal of West Nile virus is greater and far more variable than previously measured, such that its dissemination was critically determined by rare, long-range movements that are unlikely to be discerned during field observations. Our results indicate that, by ignoring this heterogeneity, previous models of the epidemic have substantially overestimated its basic reproductive number. More generally, our approach demonstrates that easily obtainable genetic data can be used to measure the spatial dynamics of natural populations that are otherwise difficult or costly to quantify.},

  abstract = {Revealing the dispersal of dengue viruses (DENV) in time and space is central to understanding their epidemiology. However, the processes that shape DENV transmission patterns at the scale of local populations are not well understood, particularly the impact of such factors as human population movement and urbanization. Herein, we investigated trends in the spatial dynamics of DENV-2 transmission in the highly endemic setting of southern Viet Nam. Through a phylogeographic analysis of 168 full-length DENV-2 genome sequences obtained from hospitalized dengue cases from 10 provinces in southern Viet Nam, we reveal substantial genetic diversity in both urban and rural areas, with multiple lineages identified in individual provinces within a single season, and indicative of frequent viral migration among communities. Focusing on the recently introduced Asian I genotype, we observed particularly high rates of viral exchange between adjacent geographic areas, and between Ho Chi Minh City, the primary urban center of this region, and populations across southern Viet Nam. Within Ho Chi Minh City, patterns of DENV movement appear consistent with a gravity model of virus dispersal, with viruses traveling across a gradient of population density. Overall, our analysis suggests that Ho Chi Minh City may act as a source population for the dispersal of DENV across southern Viet Nam, and provides further evidence that urban areas of Southeast Asia play a primary role in DENV transmission. However, these data also indicate that more rural areas are also capable of maintaining virus populations and hence fueling DENV evolution over multiple seasons.},

The rate of genome generation is unprecedented, yet there is currently no coherent nor accepted scheme for naming the expanding phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present a rational and dynamic virus nomenclature that uses a phylogenetic framework to identify those lineages that contribute most to active spread. Our system is made tractable by constraining the number and depth of hierarchical lineage labels and by flagging and delabelling virus lineages that become unobserved and hence are probably inactive. By focusing on active virus lineages and those spreading to new locations, this nomenclature will assist in tracking and understanding the patterns and determinants of the global spread of SARS-CoV-2.},

One of the fundamental quality measures in sequencing projects is the position-specific error probability at all bases in each individual sequence. Accurate prediction of base-specific error rates from ``raw'' sequence data would allow immediate quality control as well as benchmarking different methods and projects while avoiding the inefficiencies and time delays associated with resequencing and assessments after ``finishing'' a sequence. The program PHRED provides base-specific quality scores that are logarythmically related to error probabilities. This study assessed the accuracy of PHRED's error-rate prediction by analyzing sequencing projects from six different large-scale sequencing laboratories. All projects used four-color fluorescent sequencing, but the sequencing methods used varied widely between the different projects. The results indicate that the error-rate predictions such as those given by PHRED can be highly accurate for a large variety of different sequencing methods as well as over a wide range of sequence quality.},

Progress in the field of molecular evolution fuels the need for more realistic and hence more complex simulations, adapted to particular situations, yet current software makes unreasonable assumptions such as homogeneous substitution dynamics or a uniform distribution of indels across the simulated sequences. This calls for an extensible simulation framework written in a high-level functional language, offering new functionality and making it easy to incorporate further complexity. PhyloSim is an extensible framework for the Monte Carlo simulation of sequence evolution, written in R, using the Gillespie algorithm to integrate the actions of many concurrent processes such as substitutions, insertions and deletions. Uniquely among sequence simulation tools, PhyloSim can simulate arbitrarily complex patterns of rate variation and multiple indel processes, and allows for the incorporation of selective constraints on indel events. User-defined complex patterns of mutation and selection can be easily integrated into simulations, allowing PhyloSim to be adapted to specific needs. Close integration with R and the wide range of features implemented offer unmatched flexibility, making it possible to simulate sequence evolution under a wide range of realistic settings. We believe that PhyloSim will be useful to future studies involving simulated alignments.},

  abstract = {The advances in sequencing technology have made large-scale sequencing studies for large cohorts feasible. Often, the primary goal for large-scale studies is to identify genetic variants associated with a disease or other phenotypes. Even when deep sequencing is performed, there will be many sites where there is not enough data to call genotypes accurately. Ignoring the genotype classification uncertainty by basing subsequent analyses on called genotypes leads to a loss in power. Additionally, using called genotypes can lead to spurious association signals. Some methods taking the uncertainty of genotype calls into account have been proposed; most require numerical optimization which for large-scale data is not always computationally feasible. We show that using a score statistic for the joint likelihood of observed phenotypes and observed sequencing data provides an attractive approach to association testing for next-generation sequencing data. The joint model accounts for the genotype classification uncertainty via the posterior probabilities of the genotypes given the observed sequencing data, which gives the approach higher power than methods based on called genotypes. This strategy remains computationally feasible due to the use of score statistics. As part of the joint likelihood, we model the distribution of the phenotypes using a generalized linear model framework, which works for both quantitative and discrete phenotypes. Thus, the method presented here is applicable to case-control studies as well as mapping of quantitative traits. The model allows additional covariates that enable correction for confounding factors such as population stratification or cohort effects. Genet.

This article presents a new method for inferring an individual's ancestry that takes the uncertainty introduced in next generation sequencing data into account. This is achieved by working directly with genotype likelihoods that contain all relevant information of the unobserved genotypes. Using simulations as well as publicly available sequencing data, we demonstrate that the presented method has great accuracy even for very low-depth data. At the same time, we demonstrate that applying existing methods to genotypes called from the same data can introduce severe biases.

Each pair is assigned a similarity score, the sum of which enumerates the similarity between two trees. The challenge lies in quantifying split similarity: existing definitions lack a principled statistical underpinning, resulting in misleading tree distances that are difficult to interpret. Here, I propose probabilistic measures of split similarity, which allow tree similarity to be measured in natural units (bits).},

Spatiotemporally Varying Coefficients (STVC) model is the first Bayesian-based local spatiotemporal regression approach, intending to simultaneously detect spatial and temporal nonstationarity for heterogeneous response-covariate variables relationships, through separately estimating posterior local-scale coefficients over different space areas and time frames. In this paper, we first presented a general Bayesian STVC modelling paradigm as a specification guide to show its commonality in broader geospatial research. Then, we employed it to solve a real-world issue concerning spatiotemporal healthcare-socioeconomic relations, for which we derived data of county-level hospital beds number per capita, as well as data of related socioeconomic factors in northeast China during 2002\textendash 2011. Results showed that the STVC model surpassed all the other comparative regressions, in terms of both Bayesian model fitness and predictive ability. Globally, resident savings, financial institutions loans, GDP, and primary industry were identified as key socioeconomic conditions affecting healthcare resources in Northeast China. Temporally, with Time-Coefficients (TC) plots, we found that after 2011, GDP and primary industry would further help improve the overall healthcare level of northeast China. Spatially, with Space-Coefficients (SC) maps, we could directly identify the relative contribution of four socioeconomic covariates' impacts on healthcare within each administrative county.

  abstract = {Understanding and predicting a species' distribution across a landscape is of central importance in ecology, biogeography and conservation biology. However, it presents daunting challenges when populations are highly dynamic (i.e. increasing or decreasing their ranges), particularly for small populations where information about ecology and life history traits is lacking. Currently, many modelling approaches fail to distinguish whether a site is unoccupied because the available habitat is unsuitable or because a species expanding its range has not arrived at the site yet. As a result, habitat that is indeed suitable may appear unsuitable. To overcome some of these limitations, we use a statistical modelling approach based on spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox processes. These model the spatial distribution of the species across available habitat and how this distribution changes over time, relative to covariates. In addition, the model explicitly accounts for spatio-temporal dynamics that are unaccounted for by covariates through a spatio-temporal stochastic process. We illustrate the approach by predicting the distribution of a recently established population of Eurasian cranes Grus grus in England, UK, and estimate the effect of a reintroduction in the range expansion of the population. Our models show that wetland extent and perimeter-to-area ratio have a positive and negative effect, respectively, in crane colonisation probability. Moreover, we find that cranes are more likely to colonise areas near already occupied wetlands and that the colonisation process is progressing at a low rate. Finally, the reintroduction of cranes in SW England can be considered a human-assisted long-distance dispersal event that has increased the dispersal potential of the species along a longitudinal axis in S England. Spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process models offer an excellent opportunity for the study of species where information on life history traits is lacking, since these are represented through the spatio-temporal dynamics reflected in the model.},

Using a proper, yet nontruncated and uninformative prior, we demonstrate the advantages of the Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing and estimation in phylogenetics by comparing different models for the infinitesimal rates of change among nucleotides, for the number of rate classes, and for the relationships among branch lengths. We compare the relative probabilities of these models and the appropriateness of a molecular clock using Bayes factors. Our most general model, first proposed by Tamura and Nei, parameterizes the infinitesimal change probabilities among nucleotides (A, G, C, T/U) into six parameters, consisting of three parameters for the nucleotide stationary distribution, two rate parameters for nucleotide transitions, and another parameter for nucleotide transversions. Nested models include the Hasegawa, Kishino, and Yano model with equal transition rates and the Kimura model with a uniform stationary distribution and equal transition rates. To illustrate our methods, we examine simulated data, 16S rRNA sequences from 15 contemporary eubacteria, halobacteria, eocytes, and eukaryotes, 9 primates, and the entire HIV genome of 11 isolates. We find that the Kimura model is too restrictive, that the Hasegawa, Kishino, and Yano model can be rejected for some data sets, that there is evidence for more than one rate class and a molecular clock among similar taxa, and that a molecular clock can be rejected for more distantly related taxa.},

  abstract = {Bayes factors comparing two or more competing hypotheses are often estimated by constructing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler to explore the joint space of the hypotheses. To obtain efficient Bayes factor estimates, Carlin and Chib (1995, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B57, 473\textendash 484) suggest adjusting the prior odds of the competing hypotheses so that the posterior odds are approximately one, then estimating the Bayes factor by simple division. A byproduct is that one often produces several independent MCMC chains, only one of which is actually used for estimation. We extend this approach to incorporate output from multiple chains by proposing three statistical models. The first assumes independent sampler draws and models the hypothesis indicator function using logistic regression for various choices of the prior odds. The two more complex models relax the independence assumption by allowing for higher-lag dependence within the MCMC output. These models allow us to estimate the uncertainty in our Bayes factor calculation and to fully use several different MCMC chains even when the prior odds of the hypotheses vary from chain to chain. We apply these methods to calculate Bayes factors for tests of monophyly in two phylogenetic examples. The first example explores the relationship of an unknown pathogen to a set of known pathogens. Identification of the unknown's monophyletic relationship may affect antibiotic choice in a clinical setting. The second example focuses on HIV recombination detection. For potential clinical application, these types of analyses must be completed as efficiently as possible.},

Recently, lineage 3 PRRSVs, belonging to the type 2 viruses, with novel characteristics and increased virulence have been continuously re-emerging in China, thereby posing a great threat to pig farming. However, available information about lineage 3 is limited. Here, we carried out molecular epidemiological investigations for PRRSV surveillance in most regions of China from 2007 to 2017. More than 3,000 samples were obtained, amounting to 73 sequences of lineage 3 viruses. The origin, demographic history and spread pattern of lineage 3 PRRSVs were investigated combining with the database globally. Phylogeography and phylodynamic analyses within a Bayesian statistical framework revealed that lineage 3 viruses originated in Taiwan. Followed by subsequent propagation to different areas and geography, it dichotomized into two endemic clusters. South China has become an epicentre for these viruses, which diffused into China's interiors in recent years. Furthermore, viral dispersal route analysis revealed the risk of viral diffusion. Overall, the origin, epidemic history and geographical evolution of lineage 3 PRRSVs were comprehensively analysed in this study. In particular, the epicentre of southern China and the diffusion routines of the viruses are highlighted in this study, and the possible continuous transmission of the novel lineages poses the biggest threat to pig farmers.},

Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and {$\sim$}1 h of hands-on time.},

  abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to unprecedented, nearly real-time genetic tracing due to the rapid community sequencing response. Researchers immediately leveraged these data to infer the evolutionary relationships among viral samples and to study key biological questions, including whether host viral genome editing and recombination are features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This global sequencing effort is inherently decentralized and must rely on data collected by many labs using a wide variety of molecular and bioinformatic techniques. There is thus a strong possibility that systematic errors associated with lab\textemdash or protocol\textemdash specific practices affect some sequences in the repositories. We find that some recurrent mutations in reported SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been observed predominantly or exclusively by single labs, co-localize with commonly used primer binding sites and are more likely to affect the protein-coding sequences than other similarly recurrent mutations. We show that their inclusion can affect phylogenetic inference on scales relevant to local lineage tracing, and make it appear as though there has been an excess of recurrent mutation or recombination among viral lineages. We suggest how samples can be screened and problematic variants removed, and we plan to regularly inform the scientific community with our updated results as more SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are shared (https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473 and https://virological.org/t/masking-strategies-for-sars-cov-2-alignments/480). We also develop tools for comparing and visualizing differences among very large phylogenies and we show that consistent clade- and tree-based comparisons can be made between phylogenies produced by different groups. These will facilitate evolutionary inferences and comparisons among phylogenies produced for a wide array of purposes. Building on the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser at UCSC, we present a toolkit to compare, analyze and combine SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies, find and remove potential sequencing errors and establish a widely shared, stable clade structure for a more accurate scientific inference and discourse.},

Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models.

  abstract = {Viral phylodynamics is defined as the study of how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape viral phylogenies. Since the coining of the term in 2004, research on viral phylodynamics has focused on transmission dynamics in an effort to shed light on how these dynamics impact viral genetic variation. Transmission dynamics can be considered at the level of cells within an infected host, individual hosts within a population, or entire populations of hosts. Many viruses, especially RNA viruses, rapidly accumulate genetic variation because of short generation times and high mutation rates. Patterns of viral genetic variation are therefore heavily influenced by how quickly transmission occurs and by which entities transmit to one another. Patterns of viral genetic variation will also be affected by selection acting on viral phenotypes. Although viruses can differ with respect to many phenotypes, phylodynamic studies have to date tended to focus on a limited number of viral phenotypes. These include virulence phenotypes, phenotypes associated with viral transmissibility, cell or tissue tropism phenotypes, and antigenic phenotypes that can facilitate escape from host immunity. Due to the impact that transmission dynamics and selection can have on viral genetic variation, viral phylogenies can therefore be used to investigate important epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes, such as epidemic spread [2], spatio-temporal dynamics including metapopulation dynamics [3], zoonotic transmission, tissue tropism [4], and antigenic drift [5]. The quantitative investigation of these processes through the consideration of viral phylogenies is the central aim of viral phylodynamics.},

Error rates for nonreference genotype calls range from 0.1\% to 0.6\%, depending on the platform and the depth of coverage. Additionally, we found (1) no difference in the error profiles or rates between blood and saliva samples; (2) Complete Genomics sequences had substantially higher error rates than Illumina sequences had; (3) error rates were higher (up to 6\%) for rare or unique variants; (4) error rates generally declined with genotype quality (GQ) score, but in a nonlinear fashion for the Illumina data, likely due to loss of specificity of GQ scores greater than 60; and (5) error rates increased with increasing depth of coverage for the Illumina data.

  abstract = {Models of the spatial distribution of animals provide useful tools to help ecologists quantify species-environment relationships, and they are increasingly being used to help determine the impacts of climate and habitat changes on species. While high-quality survey-style data with known effort are sometimes available, often researchers have multiple datasets of varying quality and type. In particular, collections of sightings made by citizen scientists are becoming increasingly common, with no information typically provided on their observer effort. Many standard modelling approaches ignore observer effort completely, which can severely bias estimates of an animal's distribution. Combining sightings data from observers who followed different protocols is challenging. Any differences in observer skill, spatial effort, and the detectability of the animals across space all need to be accounted for. To achieve this, we build upon the recent advancements made in integrative species distribution models and present a novel marked spatio-temporal point process framework for estimating the utilization distribution (UD) of the individuals of a highly mobile species. We show that in certain settings, we can also use the framework to combine the UDs from the sampled individuals to estimate the species' distribution. We combine the empirical results from a simulation study with the implications outlined in a causal directed acyclic graph to identify the necessary assumptions required for our framework to control for observer effort when it is unknown. We then apply our framework to combine multiple datasets collected on the endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales, to estimate their monthly effort-corrected space-use.},

Phylogeography plays a major role in infectious disease surveillance, viral epidemiology and vaccine design. When conducting viral phylogeographic studies, researchers require the location of the infected host of the virus, which is often present in public databases such as GenBank. However, the geographic metadata in most GenBank records is not precise enough for many phylogeographic studies; therefore, researchers often need to search the articles linked to the records for more information, which can be a tedious process. Here, we describe two approaches for automatically detecting geographic location mentions in articles pertaining to virus-related GenBank records: a supervised sequence labeling approach with innovative features and a distant-supervision approach with novel noise- reduction methods. Evaluated on a manually annotated gold standard, our supervised sequence labeling and distant supervision approaches attained F-scores of 0.81 and 0.66, respectively.},

  abstract = {Diseases caused by zoonotic viruses (viruses transmittable between humans and animals) are a major threat to public health throughout the world. By studying virus migration and mutation patterns, the field of phylogeography provides a valuable tool for improving their surveillance. A key component in phylogeographic analysis of zoonotic viruses involves identifying the specific locations of relevant viral sequences. This is usually accomplished by querying public databases such as GenBank and examining the geospatial metadata in the record. When sufficient detail is not available, a logical next step is for the researcher to conduct a manual survey of the corresponding published articles. MOTIVATION: In this article, we present a system for detection and disambiguation of locations (toponym resolution) in full-text articles to automate the retrieval of sufficient metadata. Our system has been tested on a manually annotated corpus of journal articles related to phylogeography using integrated heuristics for location disambiguation including a distance heuristic, a population heuristic and a novel heuristic utilizing knowledge obtained from GenBank metadata (i.e. a 'metadata heuristic'). RESULTS: For detecting and disambiguating locations, our system performed best using the metadata heuristic (0.54 Precision, 0.89 Recall and 0.68 F-score). Precision reaches 0.88 when examining only the disambiguation of location names. Our error analysis showed that a noticeable increase in the accuracy of toponym resolution is possible by improving the geospatial location detection. By improving these fundamental automated tasks, our system can be a useful resource to phylogeographers that rely on geospatial metadata of GenBank sequences. .},

Here, we reconstruct HIV genetic transmission clusters using data from the United States National HIV Surveillance System and report that viruses in clusters, inferred to be frequently transmitted, have higher viral loads at diagnosis. Further, viral load is higher in people in larger clusters and with increased network connectivity, suggesting that HIV in the United States is experiencing natural selection to be more infectious and virulent. We also observe a concurrent increase in viral load at diagnosis over the last decade. This evolutionary trajectory may be slowed by prevention strategies prioritized toward rapidly growing transmission clusters.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill.

This paper reviews 3 approaches to assign support values to branches in trees obtained in the analysis of molecular sequences: the bootstrap, the Bayesian posterior probabilities for clades, and the interior branch tests. In some circumstances, these methods give different answers. It should not be surprising: their assumptions are different. Thus the interior branch tests assume that a given topology is true and only consider if a particular branch length is longer than zero. If a tree is incorrect, a wrong branch (a low bootstrap or Bayesian support may be an indication) may have a non-zero length. If the substitution model is oversimplified, the length of a branch may be overestimated, and the Bayesian support for the branch may be inflated. The bootstrap, on the other hand, approximates the variance of the data under the real model of sequence evolution, because it involves direct resampling from this data. Thus the discrepancy between the Bayesian support and the bootstrap support may signal model inaccuracy. In practical application, use of all 3 methods is recommended, and if discrepancies are observed, then a careful analysis of their potential origins should be made.},

In most cases the best model was comprised of two distributions. The major-component distribution is similar to a binomial distribution with low error and low reference bias. The minor-component distribution is overdispersed with higher error and reference bias. We also found that sites fitting the minor component are enriched for copy number variants and low complexity regions, which can produce erroneous genotype calls.

The first outbreak of CCHF occurred in the Crimean peninsula in 1944-45 and it has recently emerged in the Balkans and eastern Mediterranean. In order to reconstruct the origin and pathway of the worldwide dispersion of the virus at global and regional (eastern European) level, we investigated the phylogeography of the infection by analysing 121 publicly available CCHFV S gene sequences including two recently characterised Albanian isolates. The spatial and temporal phylogeny was reconstructed using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, which estimated a mean evolutionary rate of 2.96 x 10-4 (95\%HPD=1.6 and 4.7 x 10-4) substitutions/site/year for the analysed fragment. All of the isolates segregated into seven highly significant clades that correspond to the known geographical clades: in particular the two new isolates from northern Albania clustered significantly within the Europe 1 clade. Our phylogeographical reconstruction suggests that the global CCHFV clades originated about one thousand years ago from a common ancestor probably located in Africa. The virus then spread to Asia in the XV century and entered Europe on at least two occasions: the first in the early 1800s, when a still circulating but less or non-pathogenic virus emerged in Greece and Turkey, and the second in the early 1900s, when a pathogenic CCHFV strain began to spread in eastern Europe. The most probable location for the origin of this European clade 1 was Russia, but Turkey played a central role in spreading the virus throughout Europe. Given the close proximity of the infected areas, our data suggest that the movement of wild and domestic ungulates from endemic areas was probably the main cause of the dissemination of the virus in eastern Europe.},

We address this issue using an auxiliary variable construction combined with an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. This sampling algorithm and model make it efficient both in terms of computation and analyst's time to construct stochastic processes informed by prior knowledge, such as known properties of the states of the process. We demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our framework using synthetic and real phylogenetic protein data, where a prior based on amino acid physicochemical properties is constructed to obtain accurate rate matrix estimates.},

Using the same viral example, we also illustrate Bayesian phylodynamic inference that jointly infers time-measured trees and phylogeography, including covariates of spatial dispersal, from sequence and trait data. We highlight state-of-the-art efforts to perform such computations more efficiently. Finally, we compare the estimates obtained by both approaches and discuss their strengths and potential pitfalls.},
