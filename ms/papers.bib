	Abstract = {A metric on general phylogenetic trees is presented. This extends the work of most previous authors, who constructed metrics for binary trees. The metric presented in this paper makes possible the comparison of the many nonbinary phylogenetic trees appearing in the literature. This provides an objective procedure for comparing the different methods for constructing phylogenetic trees. The metric is based on elementary operations which transform one tree into another. Various results obtained in applying these operations are given. They enable the distance between any pair of trees to be calculated efficiently. This generalizes previous work by Bourque to the case where interior vertices can be labeled, and labels may contain more than one element or may be empty.},

@article{Poon:2013,
	Abstract = {A phylogeny is a tree-based model of common ancestry that is an indispensable tool for studying biological variation. Phylogenies play a special role in the study of rapidly evolving populations such as viruses, where the proliferation of lineages is constantly being shaped by the mode of virus transmission, by adaptation to immune systems, and by patterns of human migration and contact. These processes may leave an imprint on the shapes of virus phylogenies that can be extracted for comparative study; however, tree shapes are intrinsically difficult to quantify. Here we present a comprehensive study of phylogenies reconstructed from 38 different RNA viruses from 12 taxonomic families that are associated with human pathologies. To accomplish this, we have developed a new procedure for studying phylogenetic tree shapes based on the `kernel trick', a technique that maps complex objects into a statistically convenient space. We show that our kernel method outperforms nine different tree balance statistics at correctly classifying phylogenies that were simulated under different evolutionary scenarios. Using the kernel method, we observe patterns in the distribution of RNA virus phylogenies in this space that reflect modes of transmission and pathogenesis. For example, viruses that can establish persistent chronic infections (such as HIV and hepatitis C virus) form a distinct cluster. Although the visibly `star-like' shape characteristic of trees from these viruses has been well-documented, we show that established methods for quantifying tree shape fail to distinguish these trees from those of other viruses. The kernel approach presented here potentially represents an important new tool for characterizing the evolution and epidemiology of RNA viruses.},

	Abstract = {Emerging viruses have the potential to impose substantial mortality, morbidity and economic burdens on human populations. Tracking the spread of infectious diseases to assist in their control has traditionally relied on the analysis of case data gathered as the outbreak proceeds. Here, we describe how many of the key questions in infectious disease epidemiology, from the initial detection and characterization of outbreak viruses, to transmission chain tracking and outbreak mapping, can now be much more accurately addressed using recent advances in virus sequencing and phylogenetics. We highlight the utility of this approach with the hypothetical outbreak of an unknown pathogen, `Disease X', suggested by the World Health Organization to be a potential cause of a future major epidemic. We also outline the requirements and challenges, including the need for flexible platforms that generate sequence data in real-time, and for these data to be shared as widely and openly as possible.},

@article{10.1093/molbev/msz155,
	Abstract = {{One of the most intriguing puzzles in biology is the degree to which evolution is repeatable. The repeatability of evolution, or parallel evolution, has been studied in a variety of model systems, but has rarely been investigated with clinically relevant viruses. To investigate parallel evolution of HIV-1, we passaged two replicate HIV-1 populations for almost 1 year in each of two human T-cell lines. For each of the four evolution lines, we determined the genetic composition of the viral population at nine time points by deep sequencing the entire genome. Mutations that were carried by the majority of the viral population accumulated continuously over 1 year in each evolution line. Many majority mutations appeared in more than one evolution line, that is, our experiments showed an extreme degree of parallel evolution. In one of the evolution lines, 62\\% of the majority mutations also occur in another line. The parallelism impairs our ability to reconstruct the evolutionary history by phylogenetic methods. We show that one can infer the correct phylogenetic topology by including minority mutations in our analysis. We also find that mutation diversity at the beginning of the experiment is predictive of the frequency of majority mutations at the end of the experiment.}},

@article{Schneider:1986,
	Abstract = {Repressors, polymerases, ribosomes and other macromolecules bind to specific nucleic acid sequences. They can find a binding site only if the sequence has a recognizable pattern. We define a measure of the information (R sequence) in the sequence patterns at binding sites. It allows one to investigate how information is distributed across the sites and to compare one site to another. One can also calculate the amount of information (R frequency) that would be required to locate the sites, given that they occur with some frequency in the genome. Several Escherichia coli binding sites were analyzed using these two independent empirical measurements. The two amounts of information are similar for most of the sites we analyzed. In contrast, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase binding sites contain about twice as much information as is necessary for recognition by the T7 polymerase, suggesting that a second protein may bind at T7 promoters. The extra information can be accounted for by a strong symmetry element found at the T7 promoters. This element may be an operator. If this model is correct, these promoters and operators do not share much information. The comparisons between R sequence and R frequency suggest that the information at binding sites is just sufficient for the sites to be distinguished from the rest of the genome.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Cophylogeny is the congruence of phylogenetic relationships between two different groups of organisms due to their long-term interaction. We investigated the use of tree shape distance measures to quantify the degree of cophylogeny. We implemented a reverse-time simulation model of pathogen phylogenies within a fixed host tree, given cospeciation probability, host switching, and pathogen speciation rates. We used this model to evaluate 18 distance measures between host and pathogen trees including two kernel distances that we developed for labeled and unlabeled trees, which use branch lengths and accommodate different size trees. Finally, we used these measures to revisit published cophylogenetic studies, where authors described the observed associations as representing a high or low degree of cophylogeny. Our simulations demonstrated that some measures are more informative than others with respect to specific coevolution parameters especially when these did not assume extreme values. For real datasets, trees' associations projection revealed clustering of high concordance studies suggesting that investigators are describing it in a consistent way. Our results support the hypothesis that measures can be useful for quantifying cophylogeny. This motivates their usage in the field of coevolution and supports the development of simulation-based methods, i.e., approximate Bayesian computation, to estimate the underlying coevolutionary parameters.},

	Abstract = {Accurate estimation of the parameters characterising infectious disease transmission is vital for optimising control interventions during epidemics. A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.},

This is the first tool to simulate amplicon datasets (e.g. 16S rRNA) widely used by microbial ecologists. Grinder can create sequence libraries with a specific community structure, α and β diversities and experimental biases (e.g. chimeras, gene copy number variation) for commonly used sequencing platforms. This versatility allows the creation of simple to complex read datasets necessary for hypothesis testing when developing bioinformatic software, benchmarking existing tools or designing sequence-based experiments. Grinder is particularly useful for simulating clinical or environmental microbial communities and complements the use of in vitro mock communities. }},

	Abstract = {{Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modeling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first 3 months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation \\&gt; 90\\%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods' development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.}},

	Abstract = { Abstract To characterize HIV-1 transmission dynamics in regions where the burden of HIV-1 is greatest, the ``Phylogenetics and Networks for Generalised HIV Epidemics in Africa'' consortium (PANGEA-HIV) is sequencing full-genome viral isolates from across sub-Saharan Africa. We report the first 3,985 PANGEA-HIV consensus sequences from four cohort sites (Rakai Community Cohort Study, n = 2,833; MRC/UVRI Uganda, n = 701; Mochudi Prevention Project, n = 359; Africa Health Research Institute Resistance Cohort, n = 92). Next-generation sequencing success rates varied: more than 80\% of the viral genome from the gag to the nef genes could be determined for all sequences from South Africa, 75\% of sequences from Mochudi, 60\% of sequences from MRC/UVRI Uganda, and 22\% of sequences from Rakai. Partial sequencing failure was primarily associated with low viral load, increased for amplicons closer to the 3′ end of the genome, was not associated with subtype diversity except HIV-1 subtype D, and remained significantly associated with sampling location after controlling for other factors. We assessed the impact of the missing data patterns in PANGEA-HIV sequences on phylogeny reconstruction in simulations. We found a threshold in terms of taxon sampling below which the patchy distribution of missing characters in next-generation sequences (NGS) has an excess negative impact on the accuracy of HIV-1 phylogeny reconstruction, which is attributable to tree reconstruction artifacts that accumulate when branches in viral trees are long. The large number of PANGEA-HIV sequences provides unprecedented opportunities for evaluating HIV-1 transmission dynamics across sub-Saharan Africa and identifying prevention opportunities. Molecular epidemiological analyses of these data must proceed cautiously because sequence sampling remains below the identified threshold and a considerable negative impact of missing characters on phylogeny reconstruction is expected. },

Influenza is a particularly important disease in this context because it causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics. In order to forecast health care utilization during epidemics---and the effects of hospitalizations and deaths on the contact network and, in turn, on transmission dynamics---modellers must make assumptions about the lengths of time between infection, visiting a physician, being admitted to hospital, leaving hospital, and death. More reliable forecasts could be be made if the distributions of times between these types of events (``delay distributions'') were known.},

	Abstract = {Determining the composition of viral populations is becoming increasingly important in the field of medical virology. While recently developed computational tools for viral haplotype analysis allow for correcting sequencing errors, they do not always allow for the removal of errors occurring in the upstream experimental protocol, such as PCR errors. Primer IDs (pIDs) are one method to address this problem by harnessing redundant template resampling for error correction. By using a reference mixture of five HIV-1 strains, we show how pIDs can be useful for estimating key experimental parameters, such as the substitution rate of the PCR process and the reverse transcription (RT) error rate. In addition, we introduce a hidden Markov model for determining the recombination rate of the RT PCR process. We found no strong sequence-specific bias in pID abundances (the same RT efficiencies as compared to commonly used short, specific RT primers) and no effects of pIDs on the estimated distribution of the references viruses.},

@article{Liang:2014,
	Abstract = {{Primer IDs (pIDs) are random oligonucleotide tags used in next-generation sequencing to identify sequences that originate from the same template. These tags are produced by degenerate primers during the reverse transcription of RNA molecules into cDNA. The use of pIDs helps to track the number of RNA molecules carried through amplification and sequencing, and allows resolution of inconsistencies between reads sharing a pID. Three potential issues complicate the above applications. First, multiple cDNAs may share a pID by chance; we found that while preventing any cDNAs from sharing a pID may be unfeasible, it is still practical to limit the number of these collisions. Secondly, a pID must be observed in at least three sequences to allow error correction; as such, pIDs observed only one or two times must be rejected. If the sequencing product contains copies from a high number of RT templates but produces few reads, our findings indicate that rejecting such pIDs will discard a great deal of data. Thirdly, the use of pIDs could influence amplification and sequencing. We examined the effects of several intrinsic and extrinsic factors on sequencing reads at both the individual and ensemble level.}},

	Abstract = {Next-generation sequencing allows for cost-effective probing of virus populations at an unprecedented level of detail. The massively parallel sequencing approach can detect low-frequency mutations and it provides a snapshot of the entire virus population. However, analyzing ultra-deep sequencing data obtained from diverse virus populations is challenging because of PCR and sequencing errors and short read lengths, such that the experiment provides only indirect evidence of the underlying viral population structure. Recent computational and statistical advances allow for accommodating some of the confounding factors, including methods for read error correction, haplotype reconstruction, and haplotype frequency estimation. With these methods ultra-deep sequencing can be more reliably used to analyze, in a quantitative manner, the genetic diversity of virus populations.},

	Abstract = {{Genomic analysis has become one of the major tools for disease outbreak investigations. However, existing computational frameworks for inference of transmission history from viral genomic data often do not consider intra-host diversity of pathogens and heavily rely on additional epidemiological data, such as sampling times and exposure intervals. This impedes genomic analysis of outbreaks of highly mutable viruses associated with chronic infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus, whose transmissions are often carried out through minor intra-host variants, while the additional epidemiological information often is either unavailable or has a limited use.The proposed framework QUasispecies Evolution, Network-based Transmission INference (QUENTIN) addresses the above challenges by evolutionary analysis of intra-host viral populations sampled by deep sequencing and Bayesian inference using general properties of social networks relevant to infection dissemination. This method allows inference of transmission direction even without the supporting case-specific epidemiological information, identify transmission clusters and reconstruct transmission history. QUENTIN was validated on experimental and simulated data, and applied to investigate HCV transmission within a community of hosts with high-risk behavior. It is available at https://github.com/skumsp/QUENTIN.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

	Abstract = {Abstract Introduction HIV is a unique sexually transmitted infection (STI) that is greatly affected by other concomitant ``classical'' bacterial and viral STIs that cause genital ulcers and/or mucosal inflammation. STIs also serve as a marker for risky sexual behaviours. STIs increase infectiousness of people living with HIV by increasing the viral concentration in the genital tract, and by increasing the potential for HIV acquisition in people at risk for HIV. In addition, some STIs can increase blood HIV concentration and promote progression of disease. This review is designed to investigate the complex relationship between HIV and classical STIs. Discussion Treatment of STIs with appropriate antibiotics reduces HIV in blood, semen and female genital secretions. However, community-based trials could not reliably reduce the spread of HIV by mass treatment of STIs. Introduction of antiretroviral agents for the treatment and prevention of HIV has led to renewed interest in the complex relationship between STIs and HIV. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) reduces the infectiousness of HIV and virtually eliminates the transmission of HIV in spite of concomitant or acquired STIs. However, while ART interrupts HIV transmission, it does not stop intermittent shedding of HIV in genital secretions. Such shedding of HIV is increased by STIs, although the viral copies are not likely replication competent or infectious. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of HIV with the combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) prevents HIV acquisition in spite of concomitant STIs. Conclusions STIs remain pandemic, and the availability of ART may have led to an increase in STIs, as fear of HIV has diminished. Classical STIs present a huge worldwide health burden that cannot be separated from HIV, and they deserve far more attention than they currently receive.},

	N2 = {The shape of phylogenetic trees can be used to gain evolutionary insights. A tree's shape specifies the connectivity of a tree, while its branch lengths reflect either the time or genetic distance between branching events; well-known measures of tree shape include the Colless and Sackin imbalance, which describe the asymmetry of a tree. In other contexts, network science has become an important paradigm for describing structural features of networks and using them to understand complex systems, ranging from protein interactions to social systems. Network science is thus a potential source of many novel ways to characterize tree shape, as trees are also networks. Here, we tailor tools from network science, including diameter, average path length, and betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality, to summarize phylogenetic tree shapes. We thereby propose tree shape summaries that are complementary to both asymmetry and the frequencies of small configurations. These new statistics can be computed in linear time and scale well to describe the shapes of large trees. We apply these statistics, alongside some conventional tree statistics, to phylogenetic trees from three very different viruses (HIV, dengue fever and measles), from the same virus in different epidemiological scenarios (influenza A and HIV) and from simulation models known to produce trees with different shapes. Using mutual information and supervised learning algorithms, we find that the statistics adapted from network science perform as well as or better than conventional statistics. We describe their distributions and prove some basic results about their extreme values in a tree. We conclude that network science-based tree shape summaries are a promising addition to the toolkit of tree shape features. All our shape summaries, as well as functions to select the most discriminating ones for two sets of trees, are freely available as an R package at http://github.com/Leonardini/treeCentrality.},

	Abstract = {{The ability to simulate epidemics as a function of model parameters allows insights that are unobtainable from real datasets. Further, reconstructing transmission networks for fast-evolving viruses like Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) may have the potential to greatly enhance epidemic intervention, but transmission network reconstruction methods have been inadequately studied, largely because it is difficult to obtain `truth' sets on which to test them and properly measure their performance.We introduce FrAmework for VIral Transmission and Evolution Simulation (FAVITES), a robust framework for simulating realistic datasets for epidemics that are caused by fast-evolving pathogens like HIV. FAVITES creates a generative model to produce contact networks, transmission networks, phylogenetic trees and sequence datasets, and to add error to the data. FAVITES is designed to be extensible by dividing the generative model into modules, each of which is expressed as a fixed API that can be implemented using various models. We use FAVITES to simulate HIV datasets and study the realism of the simulated datasets. We then use the simulated data to study the impact of the increased treatment efforts on epidemiological outcomes. We also study two transmission network reconstruction methods and their effectiveness in detecting fast-growing clusters.FAVITES is available at https://github.com/niemasd/FAVITES, and a Docker image can be found on DockerHub (https://hub.docker.com/r/niemasd/favites).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

	N2 = {Background Near 60{\%} of new HIV infections in the United Kingdom are estimated to occur in men who have sex with men (MSM). Patterns of mixing between different risk groups of MSM have been suggested to spread the HIV epidemics through age-disassortative partnerships and to contribute to ethnic disparities in infection rates. Understanding these mixing patterns in transmission can help to determine which groups are at a greater risk and guide prevention.Methods We analyzed combined epidemiologic data and viral sequences from MSM diagnosed with HIV as of mid-2015 at the national level. We applied a phylodynamic source attribution model to infer patterns of transmission between groups of patients by age, ethnicity and region.Results From pair probabilities of transmission between 19 847 MSM patients, we found that potential transmitters of HIV subtype B were on average 5 months older than recipients. We also found a moderate overall assortativity of transmission by ethnic group and a stronger assortativity by region.Conclusions Our findings suggest that there is only a modest net flow of transmissions from older to young MSM in subtype B epidemics and that young MSM, both for Black or White groups, are more likely to be infected by one another than expected in a sexual network with random mixing.},

Recent findings Phylodynamic analysis has recently been applied to multiple HIV outbreaks among people who inject drugs to determine whether HIV transmission is ongoing. Large-scale analyses of datasets of HIV sequences collected for drug-resistance testing provide population-level insights into transmission patterns. One focus across world regions has been to investigate whether age-disparity is a driver of HIV transmission. In sub-Saharan Africa, researchers have examined transmission between heterosexuals and MSM and between high prevalence fishing communities and inland communities. In the US and the UK, cryptic risk groups such as nondisclosed MSM and the partners of transgender women are increasingly being uncovered based on their position in densely sampled molecular transmission networks. Summary Analysis of HIV genetic sequence can resolve viral transmission patterns between risk groups at unprecedented scales and levels of detail. Future research should focus on understanding the effect of missing data on inferences and the biases of different methods. Uncovering groups and patterns obscured from traditional epidemiolocal analyses is exciting but should not compromise the privacy of the groups in question.},

	Abstract = {{One approach to the reconstruction of infectious disease transmission trees from pathogen genomic data has been to use a phylogenetic tree, reconstructed from pathogen sequences, and annotate its internal nodes to provide a reconstruction of which host each lineage was in at each point in time. If only one pathogen lineage can be transmitted to a new host (i.e., the transmission bottleneck is complete), this corresponds to partitioning the nodes of the phylogeny into connected regions, each of which represents evolution in an individual host. These partitions define the possible transmission trees that are consistent with a given phylogenetic tree. However, the mathematical properties of the transmission trees given a phylogeny remain largely unexplored. Here, we describe a procedure to calculate the number of possible transmission trees for a given phylogeny, and we then show how to uniformly sample from these transmission trees. The procedure is outlined for situations where one sample is available from each host and trees do not have branch lengths, and we also provide extensions for incomplete sampling, multiple sampling, and the application to time trees in a situation where limits on the period during which each host could have been infected and infectious are known. The sampling algorithm is available as an R package (STraTUS).}},

This review presents the biological and theoretical foundations for recent development in this field, and shows that modern phylodynamic methods are capable of inferring realistic transmission histories from HIV sequence data. Recent findings Transmission of single or multiple genetic variants from a donor's HIV population results in donor-recipient phylogenies with combinations of monophyletic, paraphyletic, and polyphyletic patterns. Large-scale simulations and analyses of many real HIV datasets have established that transmission direction, directness, or common source often can be inferred based on HIV sequence data. Phylodynamic reconstruction of HIV transmissions that include within-host HIV diversity have recently been established and made available in several software packages. Summary Phylodynamic methods that include realistic features of HIV genetic diversification have come of age, significantly improving inference of key epidemiological parameters.

With ultradeep sequencing (UDS), in-depth characterization of transmission episodes involving minority variants is permitted. We explored HIV-1 epidemiological linkage and evaluated characteristics of transmission dynamics and transmitted drug resistance (TDR) detection through the added value of UDS. Design: HIV pol gene fragments were sequenced by UDS and Sanger sequencing on samples of 70 HIV-1-infected, treatment-naive recently diagnosed MSM. Methods: Pairwise genetic distances and maximum likelihood phylogenies were computed. Transmission events were identified as clades with branch support at least 70% and intraclade genetic difference less than 4.5%. TDR mutations were recognized from the TDR consensus list. Transmission directionality, directness and inoculum size were inferred from tree topologies. Results: Both datasets concurred in the identification of seven transmission pairs and one cluster of three patients. With UDS, direction of transmission was inferred in four out of eight chains. Evidence for multiple founder viruses was found in two out of eight chains. No transmission of minority-resistant variants was evidenced. TDR mutations prevalence in protease and reverse transcriptase fragments was 4.3% with Sanger sequencing and 18.6% with UDS. Conclusion: Although Sanger sequencing and UDS identified the same transmission chains, UDS provided additional information on founder viruses, direction of transmission and levels of TDR. Nevertheless, topology of clusters was not always consistent across gene fragments, calling for a cautious interpretation of the data. Moreover, unobserved intermediary links cannot be excluded. Phylogenetic analysis use as a forensic technique for HIV transmission investigations is risky.},

	Abstract = {{We evaluated use of phylogenetic methods to predict the direction of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission.For 33 pairs of HIV-infected patients (hereafter, ``index patients'') and their partners who acquired genetically linked HIV infection during the study, samples were collected from partners and index patients close to the time when the partner seroconverted (hereafter, ``SC samples''); for 31 pairs, samples collected from the index patient at an earlier time point (hereafter, ``early index samples'') were also available. Phylogenies were inferred using env next-generation sequences (1 tree per pair/subtype). The direction of transmission (DoT) predicted from each tree was classified as correct or incorrect on the basis of which sequences (those from the index patient or the partner) were closest to the root. DoT was also assessed using maximum parsimony to infer ancestral node states for 100 bootstrap trees.DoT was predicted correctly for both single-pair and subtype-specific trees in 22 pairs (67\\%) by using SC samples and in 23 pairs (74\\%) by using early index samples. DoT was predicted incorrectly for 4 pairs (15\\%) by using SC or early index samples. In the bootstrap analysis, DoT was predicted correctly for 18 pairs (55\\%) by using SC samples and for 24 pairs (73\\%) by using early index samples. DoT was predicted incorrectly for 7 pairs (21\\%) by using SC samples and for 4 pairs (13\\%) by using early index samples.Phylogenetic methods based solely on the tree topology of HIV env sequences, particularly without consideration of phylogenetic uncertainty, may be insufficient for determining DoT.}},

	Abstract = {Purpose
Manifestations of infection and the degree of influenza virus vary. We hypothesized that the nose/throat microbiota modifies the duration of influenza symptoms and viral shedding. Exploring these relationships may help identify additional methods for reducing influenza severity and transmission.
Methods
Using a household transmission study in Nicaragua, we identified secondary cases of influenza virus infection, defined as contacts with detectable virus or a greater than 4-fold change in hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titer. We characterized the nose/throat microbiota of secondary cases before infection and explored whether the duration of symptoms and shedding differed by bacterial community characteristics.
Results
Among 124 secondary cases of influenza, higher bacterial community diversity before infection was associated with longer shedding duration (Shannon acceleration factor [AF]: 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24, 2.10) and earlier time to infection (Shannon AF: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.97; Chao1 AF: 0.992, 95% CI: 0.986, 0.998). Neisseria and multiple other oligotypes were significantly associated with symptom and shedding durations and time to infection.
Conclusions
The nose/throat microbiota before influenza virus infection was associated with influenza symptoms and shedding durations. Further studies are needed to determine if the nose/throat microbiota is a viable target for reducing influenza symptoms and transmission.},

	Abstract = { Infectious disease outbreaks play an important role in global morbidity and mortality. Real-time epidemic forecasting provides an opportunity to predict geographic disease spread as well as case counts to better inform public health interventions when outbreaks occur. Challenges and recent advances in predictive modeling are discussed here. We identified data needs in the areas of epidemic surveillance, mobility, host and environmental susceptibility, pathogen transmissibility, population density, and healthcare capacity. Constraints in standardized case definitions and timely data sharing can limit the precision of predictive models. Resource-limited settings present particular challenges for accurate epidemic forecasting due to the lack of granular data available. Incorporating novel data streams into modeling efforts is an important consideration for the future as technology penetration continues to improve on a global level. Recent advances in machine-learning, increased collaboration between modelers, the use of stochastic semi-mechanistic models, real-time digital disease surveillance data, and open data sharing provide opportunities for refining forecasts for future epidemics. Epidemic forecasting using predictive modeling is an important tool for outbreak preparedness and response efforts. Despite the presence of some data gaps at present, opportunities and advancements in innovative data streams provide additional support for modeling future epidemics. },

	Abstract = {{A central feature of pathogen genomics is that different infectious particles (virions and bacterial cells) within an infected individual may be genetically distinct, with patterns of relatedness among infectious particles being the result of both within-host evolution and transmission from one host to the next. Here, we present a new software tool, phyloscanner, which analyses pathogen diversity from multiple infected hosts. phyloscanner provides unprecedented resolution into the transmission process, allowing inference of the direction of transmission from sequence data alone. Multiply infected individuals are also identified, as they harbor subpopulations of infectious particles that are not connected by within-host evolution, except where recombinant types emerge. Low-level contamination is flagged and removed. We illustrate phyloscanner on both viral and bacterial pathogens, namely HIV-1 sequenced on Illumina and Roche 454 platforms, HCV sequenced with the Oxford Nanopore MinION platform, and Streptococcus pneumoniae with sequences from multiple colonies per individual. phyloscanner is available from https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/phyloscanner.}},

A key technical challenge to this effort is to compute model likelihoods, which involves integrating out latent variables (genealogical histories) that live in extremely high dimensions. This is a notoriously difficult computational problem, especially when the sample size is greater than a handful and the underlying population genetic model is complex. Here, we present an efficient, flexible statistical method that can scale to larger sample sizes and more populations than previously possible. Aside from demographic inference, our method can be used in other statistical inference problems in evolutionary biology and human genetics.There has been much interest in analyzing genome-scale DNA sequence data to infer population histories, but inference methods developed hitherto are limited in model complexity and computational scalability. Here we present an efficient, flexible statistical method, diCal2, that can use whole-genome sequence data from multiple populations to infer complex demographic models involving population size changes, population splits, admixture, and migration. Applying our method to data from Australian, East Asian, European, and Papuan populations, we find that the population ancestral to Australians and Papuans started separating from East Asians and Europeans about 100,000 y ago, and that the separation of East Asians and Europeans started about 50,000 y ago, with pervasive gene flow between all pairs of populations.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most model analyses examining the role of primary HIV infection in the HIV epidemic ignore the fact that HIV is often transmitted through long-term, concurrent sexual partnerships. We sought to understand how duration and concurrency of sexual partnerships affect the role of transmissions during primary HIV infection. METHODS: We constructed a stochastic individual-based model of HIV transmission in a homogeneous population where partnerships form and dissolve. Using observed contagiousness by stage of HIV infection, the fraction of transmissions during primary HIV infection at equilibrium was examined across varying partnership durations and concurrencies. RESULTS: The fraction of transmissions during primary HIV infection has a U-shaped relationship with partnership duration. The fraction drops with increasing partnership duration for partnerships with shorter average duration but rises for partnerships with longer average duration. Partnership concurrency modifies this relationship. The fraction of transmissions during primary HIV infection increases with increasing partnership concurrency for partnerships with shorter average duration, but decreases for partnerships with longer average duration. CONCLUSIONS: Partnership patterns strongly influence the transmission of HIV and do so differentially by stage of infection. Dynamic partnerships need to be taken into account to make a robust inference on the role of different stages of HIV infection.},

Study Design: Five surveys from the United States are analyzed. Model fit is formally compared via Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion, and substantively assessed via the prediction of a generalized epidemic. Results: Formal goodness-of-fit tests do not consistently identify any model as the best all around fit to the US data. Power-law models predict a generalized sexually transmitted infection epidemic in the United States, while most alternative models do not. Conclusions: Power-law models do not fit the data better than alternative models, and they consistently make inaccurate epidemic predictions. Better models are needed to represent the behavioral basis of sexual networks and the structures that result, if these data are to be used for disease transmission modeling.},

This discrepancy is sometimes interpreted as evidence that surveys produce unreli-able data due to sex-linked response and sampling bias. We report here that among the 90{\%} of respondents reporting fewer than 20 lifetime partners, however, the ratio of male to female reports drops from 3.2:1 to 1.2:1. The anomaly thus appears to be driven by the upper tail of the contact distribution, an example of the general principle of outlier influence in data analysis. The implica-tion is that sexual behaviour surveys provide reliable data in the main, and that simple improvements can increase precision in the upper tail to make these data more useful for modelling the spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.},

	Abstract = {Author summary Google Flu Trends (GFT) was proposed as a method to estimate influenza-like illness (ILI) in the general population and to be used in conjunction with traditional surveillance systems. Several previous studies have documented that GFT estimates were often overestimates of ILI. In this study, using a recently released archive of data of provisional incidence from a large surveillance system in the US (ILINet), we report errors in GFT alongside errors from ILINet's initial estimates of ILI. This comparison using information available in real-time allows for a more nuanced assessment of GFT errors. Additionally, we describe a method to correct errors in GFT and show that the corrected GFT estimates are at least as accurate as initial estimates from ILINet. Finally, we show that inclusion of corrected GFT while forecasting ILI in the next four weeks considerably improves forecast accuracy. Taken together, our results indicate that the GFT model could have added value to traditional surveillance and forecasting systems, and a reevaluation of the utility of the underlying search trends data, which is now more openly accessible, in fields beyond influenza is warranted.},

	Abstract = {While breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence are changing society, our fundamental understanding has lagged behind. It is traditionally believed that fitting models to the training data exactly is to be avoided as it leads to poor performance on unseen data. However, powerful modern classifiers frequently have near-perfect fit in training, a disconnect that spurred recent intensive research and controversy on whether theory provides practical insights. In this work, we show how classical theory and modern practice can be reconciled within a single unified performance curve and propose a mechanism underlying its emergence. We believe this previously unknown pattern connecting the structure and performance of learning architectures will help shape design and understanding of learning algorithms.Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias{\textendash}variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias{\textendash}variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This {\textquotedblleft}double-descent{\textquotedblright} curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias{\textendash}variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.},

	Abstract = {Population structure influences genealogical patterns, however data pertaining to how populations are structured are often unavailable or not directly observable. Inference of population structure is highly important in molecular epidemiology where pathogen phylogenetics is increasingly used to infer transmission patterns and detect outbreaks. Discrepancies between observed and idealised genealogies, such as those generated by the coalescent process, can be quantified, and where significant differences occur, may reveal the action of natural selection, host population structure, or other demographic and epidemiological heterogeneities. We have developed a fast non-parametric statistical test for detection of cryptic population structure in time-scaled phylogenetic trees. The test is based on contrasting estimated phylogenies with the theoretically expected phylodynamic ordering of common ancestors in two clades within a coalescent framework. These statistical tests have also motivated the development of algorithms which can be used to quickly screen a phylogenetic tree for clades which are likely to share a distinct demographic or epidemiological history. Epidemiological applications include identification of outbreaks in vulnerable host populations or rapid expansion of genotypes with a fitness advantage. To demonstrate the utility of these methods for outbreak detection, we applied the new methods to large phylogenies reconstructed from thousands of HIV-1 partial pol sequences. This revealed the presence of clades which had grown rapidly in the recent past, and was significantly concentrated in young men, suggesting recent and rapid transmission in that group. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of these methods for the study of antimicrobial resistance, we applied the new methods to a large phylogeny reconstructed from whole genome Neisseria gonorrhoeae sequences. We find that population structure detected using these methods closely overlaps with the appearance and expansion of mutations conferring antimicrobial resistance.},

@article{Villandre:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Background Transmission patterns of sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) could relate to the structure of the underlying sexual contact network, whose features are therefore of interest to clinicians. Conventionally, we represent sexual contacts in a population with a graph, that can reveal the existence of communities. Phylogenetic methods help infer the history of an epidemic and incidentally, may help detecting communities. In particular, phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) have revealed the existence of large transmission clusters, possibly resulting from within-community transmissions. Past studies have explored the association between contact networks and phylogenies, including transmission clusters, producing conflicting conclusions about whether network features significantly affect observed transmission history. As far as we know however, none of them thoroughly investigated the role of communities, defined with respect to the network graph, in the observation of clusters.   Methods The present study investigates, through simulations, community detection from phylogenies. We simulate a large number of epidemics over both unweighted and weighted, undirected random interconnected-islands networks, with islands corresponding to communities. We use weighting to modulate distance between islands. We translate each epidemic into a phylogeny, that lets us partition our samples of infected subjects into transmission clusters, based on several common definitions from the literature. We measure similarity between subjects' island membership indices and transmission cluster membership indices with the adjusted Rand index.   Results and Conclusion Analyses reveal modest mean correspondence between communities in graphs and phylogenetic transmission clusters. We conclude that common methods often have limited success in detecting contact network communities from phylogenies. The rarely-fulfilled requirement that network communities correspond to clades in the phylogeny is their main drawback. Understanding the link between transmission clusters and communities in sexual contact networks could help inform policymaking to curb HIV incidence in MSMs.},

The rate at which eligible individuals seek relationships varies by age group and gender, and is actively manipulated using feedforward and feedback controls to ensure throughput and avoid instability. Theoretical results guarantee that the relationships formed will match the desired joint distribution, in expectation, while simultaneously avoiding throughput problems due to storage and stochastic variations.

	Abstract = {Objectives Prevention and control of gonorrhoea depends on understanding the nature of sexual networks and risk factors for infection. We aimed to use high-resolution typing (whole genome sequencing (WGS)) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates plus patient questionnaire data to gain insights into transmission patterns in a high prevalence setting.Methods During a 9-month period (July 2014{\textendash}March 2015), patients diagnosed with gonorrhoea attending sexual health service in Brighton, UK, were invited to provide anonymised detailed information by questionnaire about risk factors for infection. Questionnaire data plus WGS data from cultured isolates were analysed to yield information about sexual networks and risk factors for infection.Results 104/149 individuals who consented to participate in the study were culture positive. 97/104 (93\%) were male. 80 self-reported to be men who have sex with men (MSM). 35/104 (34\%) of patients were HIV positive. 51/104 (49\%) individuals reported using geosocial networking applications to facilitate contact. Sex under the influence of drugs was reported by 16/34 (46\%) of HIV-positive MSM, 17/41 (41\%) of HIV-negative MSM and 5/15 (31\%) of heterosexuals. WGS data were available for 100 isolates from 83 patients. 55 isolates (66\%) belonged to genetically related subtypes involving one or more patients, who could be plausibly linked through recent direct or indirect transmission. Four transmission clusters containing 3{\textendash}12 individuals were composed of MSM of mixed HIV serostatus.Conclusions We show that data obtained from WGS of N. gonorrhoeae and enhanced epidemiological data obtained from patient questionnaires are mutually supportive and reveal insights into sexual networks. Our findings suggest that serosorting may have declined as a practice and indicate the importance of designing public health interventions that target infection risks associated with recreational drug use and contact made using geosocial networking applications.},

	Abstract = {Author Summary At the start of infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) generally requires a specific protein receptor (CCR5) on the cell surface to bind and enter the cell. In roughly half of all HIV infections, the virus population eventually switches to using a different receptor (CXCR4). This `HIV coreceptor switch' is associated with an accelerated rate of progression to AIDS. Although it is not known why this switch occurs in some infections and not others, it is thought to be shaped by constraints on how HIV can evolve from one mode to another. In this study, we test this hypothesis by reconstructing the evolutionary histories of HIV within 8 patients known to have undergone an HIV coreceptor switch. Each history is recreated from samples of HIV genetic sequences that were derived from repeated blood samples by next-generation sequencing, an emerging technology that is rapidly becoming an essential tool in the study of rapidly-evolving populations such as viruses or cancerous cells. Because we have samples from different points in time, we can use models of evolution to extrapolate back in time to the ancestors of each infection. Our analysis reveals patient-specific dynamics in HIV evolution that sheds new light on the determinants of the coreceptor switch.},

An old laboratory strain (PR8) which had been through hundreds of animal passages was as readily modified by this procedure as recently recovered strains. Such variants apparently can be obtained at will and show antigenic patterns which are reproducible and appear to be predictable in terms of the immune serum used for their selection. Variant strains retain their new antigenic patterns on serial passage in ovo in the absence of immune serum. Limited serial passage in ovo of strains in the absence of immune serum did not result in the emergence of antigenic variants. Similarly, serial passages of strains in ovo in the presence of immune serum against widely different strains, which failed to show significant cross-neutralization, did not lead to the appearance of antigenic variants.},

	Abstract = {The influenza A (H1N1) virus causes seasonal epidemics that result in severe illnesses and deaths almost every year. A deep understanding of the antigenic patterns and evolution of human influenza A (H1N1) virus is extremely important for its effective surveillance and prevention. Through development of antigenicity inference method for human influenza A (H1N1), named PREDAC-H1, we systematically mapped the antigenic patterns and evolution of the human influenza A (H1N1) virus. Eight dominant antigenic clusters have been inferred for seasonal H1N1 viruses since 1977, which demonstrated sequential replacements over time with a similar pattern in Asia, Europe and North America. Among them, six clusters emerged first in Asia. As for China, three of the eight antigenic clusters were detected in South China earlier than in North China, indicating the leading role of South China in H1N1 transmission. The comprehensive view of the antigenic evolution of human influenza A (H1N1) virus can help formulate better strategy for its prevention and control.},

	Abstract = {Background
Developing timelines of nosocomial Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is critical to improving control and preventive measures. The objective of this study was to provide data-driven estimates of CDI timelines of diagnosis, isolation, and treatment in a hospital setting.
Methods
We obtained data for all CDI inpatients with symptoms onset occurring between January 1, 2013, and December 30, 2017, from St Joseph's Healthcare in Hamilton, Canada. We analyzed full empirical distributions of timelines associated with the diagnosis, isolation, and treatment of CDI.
Results
A total of 683 inpatients with CDI symptoms were recorded, of which 243 cases were identified as health care--associated infection (HAI). The mean time intervals between the onset of CDI symptoms after admission and the release of laboratory results were 1.2 days and 1.9 days for the HAI and community-associated infection (CAI) patient groups, respectively. The mean time intervals from symptoms onset to the start of isolation were 1.5 days and 2.6 days for the corresponding patient groups. The initiation of treatment within 2 days of symptoms onset reduced the duration of first isolation (P value < .0001); however, the type of initial antibiotic used for CDI treatment was not associated with the duration of isolation.
Conclusions
Estimated timelines did not differ (P values > .6) between HAI and CAI patient groups with symptoms onset after admission. These estimates are useful for evaluating the effectiveness of CDI interventions.},

	Abstract = {Background
Licensed vaccines are urgently needed for emerging infectious diseases, but the nature of these epidemics causes challenges for the design of phase III trials to evaluate vaccine efficacy. Designing and executing rigorous, fast, and ethical, vaccine efficacy trials is difficult, and the decisions and limitations in the design of these trials encompass epidemiological, logistical, regulatory, statistical, and ethical dimensions.
Results
Trial design decisions are complex and interrelated, but current guidance documents do not lend themselves to efficient decision-making. We created InterVax-Tool (http://vaxeval.com), an online, interactive decision-support tool, to help diverse stakeholders navigate the decisions in the design of phase III vaccine trials. InterVax-Tool offers high-level visual and interactive assistance through a set of four decision trees, guiding users through selection of the: (1) Primary Endpoint, (2) Target Population, (3) Randomization Scheme, and, (4) Comparator. We provide guidance on how key considerations -- grouped as Epidemiological, Vaccine-related, Infrastructural, or Sociocultural -- inform each decision in the trial design process.
Conclusions
InterVax-Tool facilitates structured, transparent, and collaborative discussion of trial design, while recording the decision-making process. Users can save and share their decisions, which is useful both for comparing proposed trial designs, and for justifying particular design choices. Here, we describe the goals and features of InterVax-Tool as well as its application to the design of a Zika vaccine efficacy trial.},

	Abstract = {In infectious disease epidemiology, clustering cases of infection in space and time is a standard method to identify and characterize outbreaks. Clustering cases by genetic similarity is analogous to spatial clustering, and may be more effective for pathogens transmitted at a relatively low rate by intimate contact. However, the statistical properties of genetic clustering in the context of out-break detection are not well characterized and cluster-defining criteria are generally set to arbitrary values. We describe a new method to optimize the predictive value of a clustering method by optimizing its parameters to maximize the difference in the Akaike information criterion (AIC) between individual-weighted and null models of cluster growth. This approach mirrors solutions to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP): the statistical association between covariates and an outcome is contingent on how their spatial distribution is partitioned into units of observation. To evaluate our method, we analyzed the distributions of pairwise Tamura-Nei (TN93) genetic distances from two published sets of anonymized HIV-1 subtype B pol sequence data stratified by collection year. We generated 46 different graphs by varying the pairwise threshold, where an edge in a graph indicates that the TN93 distance between the respective cases is below the corresponding threshold. For each graph, we generated predictions of cluster growth (numbers of new cases with edges to clusters of known cases) under two different Poisson regression models: a null model in which growth is only proportional to cluster size (i.e., no variation among individuals); and a weighted model where the variation associated with individual-level covariates are summed by cluster. Next, we calculated the AIC for each model on the distributions of observed cluster growth in two published HIV-1 pol data sets from Seattle, USA (n = 1, 653) and Alberta, Canada (n = 809). Based on the difference in AICs, we obtained different optimized TN93 thresholds for these data sets (0.014 and 0.011, respectively). We show that selection of this threshold parameter can substantially limit the utility of genetic clusters for public health, and that the optimal parameter for one population can misdirect prevention efforts in another. This statistical framework can potentially be used to optimize any clustering method, and to evaluate it against other methods including those that do not use genetic information.},

	Abstract = {Development of a vaccine against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), a life-long sexually-transmitted infection (STI), would be a major step forward in improving global sexual and reproductive health. In this review, we identified published literature of dynamic mathematical models assessing the impact of either prophylactic or therapeutic HSV-2 vaccination at the population level. We compared each study's model structure and assumptions as well as predicted vaccination impact. We examined possible causes of heterogeneity across model predictions, key gaps, and the implications of these findings for future modelling efforts. Only eight modelling studies have assessed the potential public health impact of HSV-2 vaccination, with the majority focusing on impact of prophylactic vaccines. The studies showed that even an imperfect prophylactic HSV-2 vaccine could have an important public health impact on HSV-2 incidence, and could also impact HIV indirectly in high HIV prevalence settings. Therapeutic vaccines also may provide public health benefits, though they have been explored less extensively. However, there was substantial variation in predicted population-level impact for both types of vaccine, reflecting differences in assumptions between model scenarios. Importantly, many models did not account for heterogeneity in infection rates such as by age, sex and sexual activity. Future modelling work to inform decisions on HSV vaccine development and implementation should consider cost-effectiveness, account for additional HSV-2 sequelae such as neonatal transmission, and model greater heterogeneity in infection rates between individuals, more realistic vaccine deployment, and more thorough sensitivity and uncertainty analyses.},

Average postvaccination antibody titers were similar across successive vaccinations, but the rate of antibody waning increased with each vaccination. The antibody half-life was estimated to decrease from 32 months (95\\% credible interval [CrI], 22--61 months) following first vaccination to 9 months (95\\% CrI, 7--15 months) following a seventh vaccination.Although the rate of antibody waning increased with successive vaccination, the estimated antibody half-life was longer than a typical influenza season even among the most highly vaccinated. This supports current recommendations for vaccination at the earliest opportunity. Patterns of boosting and waning might be different with the influenza A(H3N2) subtype, which evolves more rapidly and has been most associated with reduced effectiveness following repeat vaccination.}},

	Abstract = {Delays in case reporting are common to disease surveillance systems, making it difficult to track diseases in real-time. {\textquotedblleft}Nowcast{\textquotedblright} approaches attempt to estimate the complete case counts for a given reporting date, using a time series of case reports that is known to be incomplete due to reporting delays. Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmission{\textemdash}that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases{\textemdash}and are optimized to a single application, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to time-varying), and compare this approach with a published nowcasting package. We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay. We present software implementing this new approach (R package {\textquotedblleft}NobBS{\textquotedblright}) for widespread application.Significance Achieving accurate, real-time estimates of disease activity is challenged by delays in case reporting. However, approaches that seek to estimate cases in spite of reporting delays often do not consider the temporal relationship between cases during an outbreak, nor do they identify characteristics of robust approaches that generalize to a wide range of surveillance contexts with very different reporting delays. Here, we present a smooth Bayesian nowcasting approach that produces accurate estimates that capture the time evolution of the epidemic curve and outperform a previous approach in the literature. We assess the performance for two diseases to identify important features of the reporting delay distribution that contribute to the model{\textquoteright}s performance and robustness across surveillance settings.},

	Abstract = {{The regression discontinuity design (RDD), first proposed in the educational psychology literature and popularized in econometrics in the 1960s, has only recently been applied to epidemiologic research. A critical aim of infectious disease epidemiologists and global health researchers is to evaluate disease prevention and control strategies, including the impact of vaccines and vaccination programs. RDDs have very rarely been used in this context. This quasi-experimental approach using observational data is designed to quantify the effect of an intervention when eligibility for the intervention is based on a defined cutoff such as age or grade in school, making it ideally suited to estimating vaccine effects given that many vaccination programs and mass-vaccination campaigns define eligibility in this way. Here, we describe key features of RDDs in general, then specific scenarios, with examples, to illustrate that RDDs are an important tool for advancing our understanding of vaccine effects. We argue that epidemiologic researchers should consider RDDs when evaluating interventions designed to prevent and control diseases. This approach can address a wide range of research questions, especially those for which randomized clinical trials would present major challenges or be infeasible. Finally, we propose specific ways in which RDDs could advance future vaccine research.}},

	Abstract = {Infectious disease outbreaks are often characterized by the reproduction number R and exponential rate of growth r. R provides information about outbreak control and predicted final size, but estimating R is difficult, while r can often be estimated directly from incidence data. These quantities are linked by the generation interval -- the time between when an individual is infected by an infector, and when that infector was infected. It is often infeasible to obtain the exact shape of a generation-interval distribution, and to understand how this shape affects estimates of R. We show that estimating generation interval mean and variance provides insight into the relationship between R and r. We use examples based on Ebola, rabies and measles to explore approximations based on gamma-distributed generation intervals, and find that use of these simple approximations are often sufficient to capture the r--R relationship and provide robust estimates of R.},

	Abstract = {Author summary Many pathogens evolve so rapidly that they accumulate genetic differences within a host before becoming transmitted to the next host. Consequently, clusters of sampled infections with nearly identical genomes may reveal outbreaks of recent or ongoing transmissions. There is rapidly growing interest in using model-free genetic clustering methods to guide public health responses to epidemics in near real-time, including HIV, Ebola virus and tuberculosis. However, we show that current methods are relatively ineffective at detecting transmission outbreaks; instead, they are predominantly influenced by how infections are sampled from the population. We describe a fundamentally new approach to genetic clustering that is based on modelling changes in transmission rates during the spread of the epidemic. We use simulated and real pathogen sequence data sets to demonstrate that this model-based approach is substantially more effective for detecting transmission outbreaks, and remains fast enough for real-time applications to large sequence databases.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Background
HIV evolves rapidly and therefore infections with similar genetic sequences are likely linked by recent transmission events. Clusters of related infections can represent subpopulations with high rates of transmission. We describe the implementation of an automated near real-time system to monitor and characterise HIV transmission hotspots in British Columbia, Canada.
Methods
In this implementation case study, we applied a monitoring system to the British Columbia drug treatment database, which holds more than 32 000 anonymised HIV genotypes for nearly 9000 residents of British Columbia living with HIV. On average, five to six new HIV genotypes are deposited in the database every day, which triggers an automated reanalysis of the entire database. We extracted clusters of five or more individuals with short phylogenetic distances between their respective HIV sequences. The system generated monthly reports of the growth and characteristics of clusters that were distributed to public health officers.
Findings
In June, 2014, the monitoring system detected the expansion of a cluster by 11 new cases during 3 months, including eight cases with transmitted drug resistance. This cluster generally comprised young men who have sex with men. The subsequent report precipitated an enhanced public health follow-up to ensure linkage to care and treatment initiation in the affected subpopulation. Of the nine cases associated with this follow-up, all had already been linked to care and five cases had started treatment. Subsequent to the follow-up, three additional cases started treatment and most cases achieved suppressed viral loads. During the next 12 months, we detected 12 new cases in this cluster with reduction in the onward transmission of drug resistance.
Interpretation
Our findings show the first application of an automated phylogenetic system monitoring a clinical database to detect a recent HIV outbreak and support the ensuing public health response. By making secondary use of routinely collected HIV genotypes, this approach is cost-effective, attains near real-time monitoring of new cases, and can be implemented in all settings in which HIV genotyping is the standard of care.

	Abstract = {For dengue fever and other seasonal epidemics we show how the stability of the preceding inter-outbreak period can predict subsequent total outbreak magnitude, and that a feasible stability metric can be computed from incidence data alone. As an observable of a dynamical system, incidence data contains information about the underlying mechanisms: climatic drivers, changing serotype pools, the ecology of the vector populations, and evolving viral strains. We present mathematical arguments to suggest a connection between stability measured in incidence data during the inter-outbreak period and the size of the effective susceptible population. The method is illustrated with an analysis of dengue incidence in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where forecasts can be made as early as three to four months ahead of an outbreak. These results have immediate significance for public health planning, and can be used in combination with existing forecasting methods and more comprehensive dengue models.},

	Abstract = {{Influenza vaccine effectiveness was low in 2017--2018, yet circulating influenza A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically similar to cell-grown vaccine strains. Notably, most influenza vaccines are egg propagated.Serum specimens were collected shortly after illness onset from 15 influenza A(H3N2) virus--infected cases and 15 uninfected hospitalized adults. Geometric mean titers against egg- and cell-grown influenza A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2) virus vaccine strains and representative circulating viruses (including A/Washington/16/2017) were determined by a microneutralization (MN) assay. Independent effects of strain-specific titers on susceptibility were estimated by logistic regression.MN titers against egg-grown influenza A/Hong Kong virus were significantly higher among vaccinated individuals (173 vs 41; P = 0.01). In unadjusted models, a 2-fold increase in titers against egg-grown influenza A/Hong Kong virus was not significantly protective (29\\% reduction; P = .09), but a similar increase in the cell-grown influenza A/Washington virus antibody titer (3C.2a2) was protective (60\\% reduction; P = .02). Higher egg-grown influenza A/Hong Kong virus titers were not significantly associated with infection, when adjusted for antibody titers against influenza A/Washington virus (15\\% reduction; P = .61). A 54\\% reduction in the odds of infection was observed with a 2-fold increase in titer against influenza A/Washington virus (P = not significant), adjusted for the titer against egg-grown influenza A/Hong Kong virus titer.Individuals vaccinated in 2017--2018 had high antibody titers against the egg-adapted vaccine strain and lower titers against circulating viruses. Titers against circulating but not egg-adapted strains were correlated with protection.}},

	Abstract = { Despite continued efforts to improve health systems worldwide, emerging pathogen epidemics remain a major public health concern. Effective response to such outbreaks relies on timely intervention, ideally informed by all available sources of data. The collection, visualization and analysis of outbreak data are becoming increasingly complex, owing to the diversity in types of data, questions and available methods to address them. Recent advances have led to the rise of outbreak analytics, an emerging data science focused on the technological and methodological aspects of the outbreak data pipeline, from collection to analysis, modelling and reporting to inform outbreak response. In this article, we assess the current state of the field. After laying out the context of outbreak response, we critically review the most common analytics components, their inter-dependencies, data requirements and the type of information they can provide to inform operations in real time. We discuss some challenges and opportunities and conclude on the potential role of outbreak analytics for improving our understanding of, and response to outbreaks of emerging pathogens. This article is part of the theme issue `Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control`. This theme issue is linked with the earlier issue `Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes'. },

	Abstract = {H1N1 is the earliest emerging subtype of influenza A viruses with available genomic sequences, has caused several pandemics and seasonal epidemics, resulting in millions of deaths and enormous economic losses. Timely determination of new antigenic variants is crucial for the vaccine selection and flu prevention. In this study, we chronologically divided the H1N1 strains into several periods in terms of the epidemics and pandemics. Computational models have been constructed to predict antigenic variants based on epidemic and pandemic periods. By sequence analysis, we demonstrated the diverse mutation patterns of HA1 protein on different periods and that an individual model built upon each period can not represent the variations of H1N1 virus. A stacking model was established for the prediction of antigenic variants, combining all the variation patterns across periods, which would help assess a new influenza strain's antigenicity. Three different feature extraction methods, i.e. residue-based, regional band-based and epitope region-based, were applied on the stacking model to verify its feasibility and robustness. The results showed the capability of determining antigenic variants prediction with accuracy as high as 0.908 which performed better than any of the single models. The prediction performance using the stacking model indicates clear distinctions of mutation patterns and antigenicity between epidemic and pandemic strains. It would also facilitate rapid determination of antigenic variants and influenza surveillance.},

	Abstract = {{Modern phylodynamic methods interpret an inferred phylogenetic tree as a partial transmission chain providing information about the dynamic process of transmission and removal (where removal may be due to recovery, death or behaviour change). Birth-death and coalescent processes have been introduced to model the stochastic dynamics of epidemic spread under common epidemiological models such as the SIS and SIR models, and are successfully used to infer phylogenetic trees together with transmission (birth) and removal (death) rates. These methods either integrate analytically over past incidence and prevalence to infer rate parameters, and thus cannot explicitly infer past incidence or prevalence, or allow such inference only in the coalescent limit of large population size. Here we introduce a particle filtering framework to explicitly infer prevalence and incidence trajectories along with phylogenies and epidemiological model parameters from genomic sequences and case count data in a manner consistent with the underlying birth-death model. After demonstrating the accuracy of this method on simulated data, we use it to assess the prevalence through time of the early 2014 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. Key words: phylodynamics, particle filter, epidemiology, Bayesian phylogenetics}},

	Abstract = {Emerging and re-emerging pathogens exhibit very complex dynamics, are hard to model and difficult to predict. Their dynamics might appear intractable. However, new statistical approaches---rooted in dynamical systems and the theory of stochastic processes---have yielded insight into the dynamics of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. We argue that these approaches may lead to new methods for predicting epidemics. This perspective views pathogen emergence and re-emergence as a ``critical transition,'' and uses the concept of noisy dynamic bifurcation to understand the relationship between the system observables and the distance to this transition. Because the system dynamics exhibit characteristic fluctuations in response to perturbations for a system in the vicinity of a critical point, we propose this information may be harnessed to develop early warning signals. Specifically, the motion of perturbations slows as the system approaches the transition.},

	Abstract = {Seasonal influenza poses serious problems for global public health, being a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. In England, there has been a long-standing national vaccination programme, with vaccination of at-risk groups and children offering partial protection against infection. Transmission models have been a fundamental component of analysis, informing the efficient use of limited resources. However, these models generally treat each season and each strain circulating within that season in isolation. Here, we amalgamate multiple data sources to calibrate a susceptible-latent-infected-recovered type transmission model for seasonal influenza, incorporating the four main strains and mechanisms linking prior season epidemiological outcomes to immunity at the beginning of the following season. Data pertaining to nine influenza seasons, starting with the 2009/10 season, informed our estimates for epidemiological processes, virological sample positivity, vaccine uptake and efficacy attributes, and general practitioner influenza-like-illness consultations as reported by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC). We performed parameter inference via approximate Bayesian computation to assess strain transmissibility, dependence of present season influenza immunity on prior protection, and variability in the influenza case ascertainment across seasons. This produced excellent agreement between model and data on the annual strain composition. Parameter fits indicated that the propagation of immunity from one season to the next is weaker if vaccine derived, compared to natural immunity from infection. Projecting the dynamics forward in time suggests that while historic immunity plays an important role in determining annual strain composition, the variability in vaccine efficacy hampers our ability to make long-term predictions.},

@article{AKHMETZHANOV2019,
	Abstract = {During an Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, the analysis and forecasting of the incidence in real time is challenged by reporting of cases, especially the reporting delay. It should be remembered that the latest count of cases is likely underestimated in real time, and moreover, the effective reproduction number, i.e. the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case at a given point in time, is also underestimated without proper adjustment. The present study aimed to adjust the reporting delay to appropriately estimate the latest incidence and obtain short-term forecasts from weekly reporting data of EVD in North Kivu, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). A semi-structured modeling approach was taken, accounting for reporting delay which can depend on time. The mean reporting delay was estimated at 11.6 days (95% CI: 11.3, 11.9) and the standard deviation was estimated to have changed from 26 November 2019 from 8.5 to 6.0 days. Nowcasting was successfully implemented by account for the time-dependent reporting delay: it mostly contained future observed values within the 95% confidence intervals, but there were failures when the reported incidence abruptly changed over time. Forecasting was also exercised in a similar manner to the nowcasting, while we imposed an extrapolation approach to the effective reproduction number for two future weeks. Moving average of the reproduction numbers for a few weeks prior the latest time of observation outperformed other extrapolations. The information that we can gain from real time (i.e. sequential) update of ``situation report'' can be considerably improved by integrating the proposed nowcasting and forecasting to the surveillance system.},

@article{Miranda:2019,
	Abstract = {Seasonal influenza is a worldwide public health concern. Forecasting its dynamics can improve the management of public health regulations, resources and infrastructure, and eventually reduce mortality and the costs induced by influenza-related absenteism. In Belgium, a network of Sentinel General Practitioners (SGPs) is in place for the early detection of the seasonal influenza epidemic. This surveillance network reports the weekly incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, which makes it possible to detect the epidemic onset, as well as other characteristics of the epidemic season. In this paper, we present an approach for predicting the weekly ILI incidence in real-time by resorting to a dynamically calibrated compartmental model, which furthermore takes into account the dynamics of other influenza seasons. In order to validate the proposed approach, we used data collected by the Belgian SGPs for the influenza seasons 2010--2016. In spite of the great variability among different epidemic seasons, providing weekly predictions makes it possible to capture variations in the ILI incidence. The confidence region becomes more representative of the epidemic behavior as ILI data from more seasons become available. Since the SIR model is then calibrated dynamically every week, the predicted ILI curve gets rapidly tuned to the dynamics of the ongoing season. The results show that the proposed method can be used to characterize the overall behavior of an epidemic.},

	Abstract = {{The National HIV/AIDS Strategy has set ambitious goals to improve the epidemic in the United States. However, there is a paucity of usable program-level benchmarks tied to population-level epidemiologic goals. Our objective was to define tangible benchmarks for annual rates along the care continuum that are likely to translate to meaningful reductions in incidence.We used a validated mathematical model of HIV transmission and care engagement to characterize care continuum parameters that would translate into 50\\% reductions in incidence by 2025, compared with a base case scenario of the current US care continuum. We generated a large pool of simulations in which rates of screening, linkage, and retention in care were varied across wide ranges to evaluate permutations that halved incidence by 2025.Among all simulations, 7\\% achieved a halving of incidence. It was impossible for our simulations to achieve this target if the annual rate of disengagement from care exceeded 20\\% per year, even at high rates of care reengagement. When retention in care was 95\\% per year and people living with HIV (PLWH) out of care reengaged within 1.5 years (on average), the probability of halving incidence by 2025 was approximately 90\\%.HIV programs should aim to retain at least 95\\% of PLWH in care annually and reengage people living with HIV into care within an average of 1.5 years to achieve the goal of halving HIV incidence by 2025.}},

	N2 = {Summary Background In November, 2014, a cluster of HIV infections was detected among people who inject drugs in Scott County, IN, USA, with 215 HIV infections eventually attributed to the outbreak. This study examines whether earlier implementation of a public health response could have reduced the scale of the outbreak. Methods In this modelling study, we derived weekly case data from the HIV outbreak in Scott County, IN, and on the uptake of HIV testing, treatment, and prevention services from publicly available reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and researchers from Indiana. Our primary objective was to determine if an earlier response to the outbreak could have had an effect on the number of people infected. We computed upper and lower bounds for cumulative HIV incidence by digitally extracting data from published images from a CDC study using Bio-Rad avidity incidence testing to estimate the recency of each transmission event. We constructed a generalisation of the susceptible-infectious-removed model to capture the transmission dynamics of the HIV outbreak. We computed non-parametric interval estimates of the number of individuals with an undiagnosed HIV infection, the case-finding rate per undiagnosed HIV infection, and model-based bounds for the HIV transmission rate throughout the epidemic. We used these models to assess the potential effect if the same intervention had begun at two key timepoints earlier than the actual date of the initiation of efforts to control the outbreak. Findings The upper bound for undiagnosed HIV infections in Scott County peaked at 126 around Jan 10, 2015, over 2 months before the Governor of Indiana declared a public health emergency on March 26, 2015. Applying the observed case-finding rate scale-up to earlier intervention times suggests that an earlier public health response could have substantially reduced the total number of HIV infections (estimated to have been 183--184 infections by Aug 11, 2015). Initiation of a response on Jan 1, 2013, could have suppressed the number of infections to 56 or fewer, averting at least 127 infections; whereas an intervention on April 1, 2011, could have reduced the number of infections to ten or fewer, averting at least 173 infections. Interpretation Early and robust surveillance efforts and case finding alone could reduce nascent epidemics. Ensuring access to HIV services and harm-reduction interventions could further reduce the likelihood of outbreaks, and substantially mitigate their severity and scope.

	Abstract = {HIV patients form clusters in HIV transmission networks. Accurate identification of these transmission clusters is essential to effectively target public health interventions. One reason for clustering is that the underlying contact network contains many local communities. We present a new maximum-likelihood method for identifying transmission clusters caused by community structure, based on phylogenetic trees. The method employs a multi-state birth-death (MSBD) model which detects changes in transmission rate, which are interpreted as the introduction of the epidemic into a new susceptible community, i.e. the formation of a new cluster. We show that the MSBD method is able to reliably infer the clusters and the transmission parameters from a pathogen phylogeny based on our simulations. In contrast to existing cutpoint-based methods for cluster identification, our method does not require that clusters be monophyletic nor is it dependent on the selection of a difficult-to-interpret cutpoint parameter. We present an application of our method to data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. The method is available as an easy-to-use R package.},

	Abstract = {The study aimed to characterize the molecular epidemiology, phylogenetic relationship, and population dynamics of the G protein gene in clinical respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strains isolated from northern Taiwan. We analyzed a total of 160 and 116 G protein gene sequences of RSV-A and RSV-B representative strains, respectively, from 804 clinical viral stocks collected between July 2000 and June 2016. Population dynamic patterns of the RSV G protein gene were analyzed using Bayesian inference through the Markov chain Monte Carlo framework. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that RSV-A from Taiwan could be categorized into GA2, GA5, and GA7 lineages. GA2 of RSV-A could be further divided into NA1, NA2, NA4, and ON1 clades. These RSV-A lineages has been replaced over time, whereas RSV-B strains from Taiwan continually evolved from a single lineage with significant time-dependent waves. Four putative positive selection sites were observed in both RSV-A and RSV-B. The Bayesian skyline plot revealed that the local population dynamics of RSV were associated with lineage displacement events. Both circulating subtypes and population dynamics represented a unique local pattern. Our results affirm the necessity of continuing molecular surveillance of RSV to attain a more comprehensive understanding of epidemics.},

@article{Metzig:2019,
	Abstract = {Author summary Understanding whether and how transmission patterns are revealed by branching patterns in phylogenetic trees for pathogens remains a challenging research question. Besides the diversification of the pathogen, branching patterns depend strongly on the host contact structure as it shapes opportunities for the pathogen to reproduce. However, the host contact network is often difficult to study, in particular as it evolves in time. In this paper we perform a simulation study on three different dynamic networks, on which we simulate transmission trees. We use a simple Erd{\H o}s-Renyi random network and two more realistic networks with skewed degree distribution, where one is also clustered. We convert transmission trees into phylogenetic trees and analyze them with different tree statistics like imbalance measures, counts of small substructures, and measures containing the branch lengths. We study the tree features with principal component analysis and with supervised learning methods, and find that network dynamics and network type can strongly influence the shape of phylogenetic trees. This implies that using phylogenetic trees from a mis-specified network type and dynamic can lead to poor phylodynamic estimation of transmission parameters. We illustrate this with HIV phylogenetic trees constructed from viral sequences of patients in the Dutch ATHENA cohort, and from sequences of the Los Alamos Sequence database.},

	Abstract = {H3N2 influenza viruses have now circulated in the human population for 43 years since the pandemic of 1968, accumulating sequence changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) that are believed to be predominantly due to selection for escape from antibodies. Examination of mutations that persist and accumulate led to identification of antigenically significant mutations that are contained in five antigenic sites (A-E) mapped on to the H3 HA. In early H3N2 isolates, antigenic site A appeared to be dominant while in the 1990s site B seemed more important. To obtain experimental evidence for dominance of antigenic sites on modern H3 HAs, we have measured antibodies in plasma of human subjects who received the 2006-07 trivalent subunit influenza vaccine (H3 component A/Wisconsin/67/05) or the 2008-09 formulation (H3 component A/Uruguay/716/07). Plasmas were tested against expressed HA of Wisconsin-like influenza A/Oklahoma/309/06 and site-directed mutants in antigenic site A (NNES121-124ITEG, N126T, N133D, TSSS135-138GSNA, K140I, RSNNS142-146PGSG), and antigenic site B (HL156-157KS, KFK158-160GST, NDQI189-192QEQT, A196V). "Native ELISA" analysis and escape mutant selection with two human monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that antibody E05 binds to antigenic site A and 1_C02 binds to site B. We find that most individuals, after vaccination in seasons 2006-07 and/or 2008-09, showed dominance of antigenic site B recognition over antigenic site A. A minority showed dominance of site A in 2006 but these were reduced in 2008 when the vaccine virus had a site A mutation. A better understanding of immunodominance may allow prediction of future antigenic drift and assist in vaccine strain selection.},

These rmAbs were all reactive against the HA1 region of HA, but display 7 distinct binding footprints, targeting each of the 4 known antigenic sites. Although the rmAbs were not broadly cross-reactive, a group showed subtype-specific cross-reactivity with the HA of A/South Carolina/1/18. Screening these rmAbs with a panel of human A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates indicated that naturally-occurring changes in HA could reduce rmAb binding, HI activity, and/or virus neutralization activity by rmAb, without showing changes in recognition by polyclonal antiserum. In some instances, virus neutralization was lost while both ELISA binding and HI activity were retained, demonstrating a discordance between the two serological assays traditionally used to detect antigenic drift.},

	Abstract = {Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) contains antigenic sites recognized by the host immune system, cleavage sites cleaved by host proteases, receptor binding sites attaching to sialyl receptors on the target cell, and fusion peptides mediating membrane fusion. Change in an amino acid(s) in these sites may affect the potential of virus infection and spread within and between hosts. Influenza viruses with H1 HA infect birds, pigs and humans and have caused two of the four pandemics in the past 100 years: 1918 pandemic that killed 21-50 million people and 2009 pandemic that caused more than 18,000 deaths. Understanding the relationship between antigenic structure and immune specificity, the receptor binding specificity in virus transmission, how the cleavage site controls pathogenicity, and how the fusion peptide causes membrane fusion for the entry of influenza virus into the host cell should provide information to find more effective ways to prevent and control influenza.},

@article{Jou:1980aa,
	Abstract = {The complete sequence of a hemagglutinin (HA) gene of a recent human influenza A strain, A/Victoria/3/75, is 1768 nucleotides long and contains the information for 567 amino acids. It codes for a signal peptide of 16 amino acids, the HA1 chain of the mature hemagglutinin of 329 amino acids, a connecting region between HA1 and HA2 consisting of a single arginine residue and the HA2 portion of 221 amiino acids. The sequence is compared with the hemagglutinin of two members of other subtypes, the human H2 strain A/Jap/305/57 and the avian Hav1 strain A/FPV/Rostock/34, and with one of the same H3 subtype, A/Memphis/3/72. To align the HA1 chain of different major subtypes several deletions/insertions of single amino acids must be invoked, but two more extensive differences are found at both ends, one leading to an extension of the amino terminal sequence of HA1 and the other (four residues) occurring in the region processed away between HA1 and HA2. Comparison of the HA1 of two H3 strains suggests that drift probably depends on single base mutations, some of which change antigenic determinants. The HA2 region, which apparently is not involved in the immune response, is highly conserved even between different subtypes, and single base substitutions account for all the observed diversity. A hydrophobic segment of 24 residues is present in the same position close to the carboxyl terminus of HA2 in both Victoria and FPV, and presumably functions in implantation into the lipid bilayer. The many conserved features not only in HA2 but also in HA1 suggest a rather rigid architecture for the whole hemagglutinin molecule.},

	Abstract = {The rapid development of sequencing technologies has to led to an explosion of pathogen sequence data, which are increasingly collected as part of routine surveillance or clinical diagnostics. In public health, sequence data are used to reconstruct the evolution of pathogens, to anticipate future spread, and to target interventions. In clinical settings, whole-genome sequencing can identify pathogens at the strain level, can be used to predict phenotypes such as drug resistance and virulence, and can inform treatment by linking closely related cases. While sequencing has become cheaper, the analysis of sequence data has become an important bottleneck. Deriving interpretable and actionable results for a large variety of pathogens, each with its own complexity, from continuously updated data is a daunting task that requires flexible bioinformatic workflows and dissemination platforms. Here, we review recent developments in real-time analyses of pathogen sequence data, with a particular focus on the visualization and integration of sequence and phenotype data.},

	Abstract = {Influenza viruses undergo continual antigenic evolution allowing mutant viruses to evade host immunity acquired to previous virus strains. Antigenic phenotype is often assessed through pairwise measurement of cross-reactivity between influenza strains using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Here, we extend previous approaches to antigenic cartography, and simultaneously characterize antigenic and genetic evolution by modeling the diffusion of antigenic phenotype over a shared virus phylogeny. Using HI data from influenza lineages A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, we determine patterns of antigenic drift across viral lineages, showing that A/H3N2 evolves faster and in a more punctuated fashion than other influenza lineages. We also show that year-to-year antigenic drift appears to drive incidence patterns within each influenza lineage. This work makes possible substantial future advances in investigating the dynamics of influenza and other antigenically-variable pathogens by providing a model that intimately combines molecular and antigenic evolution.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two important challenges to the use of serological assays for influenza surveillance include the substantial amount of experimental effort involved and the inherent noisiness of serological data.
RESULTS: I show that log-transformed serological data exist in an effectively one-dimensional space. I use this result, together with new mechanistic insights into serological assays, to develop computational methods for accurately and efficiently recovering unmeasured serological data from a sample of measured data, for systematically minimizing noise and other types of non-antigenic variation found in the data, and for quantifying and visualizing antigenic variation. The methods can also be applied to data with effective dimensionality greater than one, under certain conditions.
CONCLUSION: Careful application of the methods developed here would enable the collection of better-quality serological data on a greater number of circulating influenza viruses than is currently possible and improve the ability to identify potential epidemic and pandemic viruses before they become widespread. Although the focus here is on influenza surveillance, the described methods are more widely applicable.},

	Abstract = {When analysing new emerging infectious disease outbreaks, one typically has observational data over a limited period of time and several parameters to estimate, such as growth rate, the basic reproduction number R0, the case fatality rate and distributions of serial intervals, generation times, latency and incubation times and times between onset of symptoms, notification, death and recovery/discharge. These parameters form the basis for predicting a future outbreak, planning preventive measures and monitoring the progress of the disease outbreak. We study inference problems during the emerging phase of an outbreak, and point out potential sources of bias, with emphasis on: contact tracing backwards in time, replacing generation times by serial intervals, multiple potential infectors and censoring effects amplified by exponential growth. These biases directly affect the estimation of, for example, the generation time distribution and the case fatality rate, but can then propagate to other estimates such as R0 and growth rate. We propose methods to remove or at least reduce bias using statistical modelling. We illustrate the theory by numerical examples and simulations.},

@article{Goeyvaerts:2018aa,
	Abstract = { Airborne infectious diseases such as influenza are primarily transmitted from human to human by means of social contacts, and thus easily spread within households. Epidemic models, used to gain insight into infectious disease spread and control, typically rely on the assumption of random mixing within households. Until now, there has been no direct empirical evidence to support this assumption. Here, we present the first social contact survey specifically designed to study contact networks within households. The survey was conducted in Belgium (Flanders and Brussels) from 2010 to 2011. We analysed data from 318 households totalling 1266 individuals with household sizes ranging from two to seven members. Exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) were fitted to the within-household contact networks to reveal the processes driving contact between household members, both on weekdays and weekends. The ERGMs showed a high degree of clustering and, specifically on weekdays, decreasing connectedness with increasing household size. Furthermore, we found that the odds of a contact between older siblings and between father and child are smaller than for any other pair. The epidemic simulation results suggest that within-household contact density is the main driver of differences in epidemic spread between complete and empirical-based household contact networks. The homogeneous mixing assumption may therefore be an adequate characterization of the within-household contact structure for the purpose of epidemic simulations. However, ignoring the contact density when inferring based on an epidemic model will result in biased estimates of within-household transmission rates. Further research regarding the implementation of within-household contact networks in epidemic models is necessary.},

	Abstract = {The recent emergence of H1N1 (swine flu) illustrates the ability of the influenza virus to create antigens new to the human immune system, even within a given hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtype. This new H1N1 strain is sufficiently distinct, for example, from the A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like virus strain of influenza in the 2008/09 Northern hemisphere vaccine that protection is not expected to be substantial. The human immune system responds primarily to the five epitope regions of the hemagglutinin protein. By determining the fraction of amino acids that differ between a vaccine strain and a viral challenge strain in the dominant epitope regions, a measure of antigenic distance that correlates with epidemiological studies of H3 influenza A vaccine efficacy in humans with R(2) = 0.81 is derived. This measure of antigenic distance is called p(epitope). The relation between vaccine efficacy and p(epitope) is given by E = 0.47 - 2.47 x p(epitope). We here identify the epitope regions of H1 hemagglutinin, so that vaccine efficacy may be reliably estimated for H1N1 influenza A.},

An analysis of N-terminal cleavage sites for thirteen subtypes of influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) sequences, has previously been described by Nobusawa and colleagues. We have expanded this analysis for the eighteen known subtypes of influenza. Due to differences in the length of HA, we have included strains from multiple clades of H1 and H5, as well as strains of H5 and H7 subtypes with both high and low pathogenicity. Analysis of known structures of influenza A HA enables us to define amino acids which are structurally and functionally equivalent across all HA subtypes using a numbering system based on the mature HA sequence. We provide a list of equivalences for amino acids which are known to affect the phenotype of the virus.},

	Abstract = {Author Summary Influenza infection kills thousands of people every year and causes major pandemics every few decades. The most lethal outbreak of influenza known was the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic that killed an estimated 20 to 100 million people. The 1918 virus was likely introduced into the human population from birds. We previously described five human neutralizing antibodies from survivors of the 1918 pandemic that bind the hemagglutinin (HA) surface antigen. Here, we define the binding sites of antibodies 1F1 and 1I20 on the 1918 HA and demonstrate that these overlap with the glycan receptor binding site. The glycan specificity differs between human and avian viruses for the linkages of the sialylated sugar receptors [human (α2--6) or avian (α2--3)]. 1F1 and 1I20 binds viruses that contain HA residues that mediate preference for α2--6 sialylated sugars. Three other control antibodies were not affected by preferences for the linkages of the sialylated sugar receptors because they bind elsewhere. Since the receptor-binding site is relatively conserved, this may explain the cross-reactivity of 1F1 and the enhanced binding of 1F1 and 1I20 to HAs with human receptor specificity.},

Antigenic mismatch between circulating strains and vaccine strains results in significantly decreased vaccine effectiveness. Furthermore, antigenic relatedness between the vaccine strain and the strains an individual was originally primed with can affect the cross-reactivity of the antibody response. Thus, understanding the antigenic relationships between influenza viruses that have circulated is important to both vaccinologists and immunologists.},

@article{Lapedes:2001aa,
	Abstract = {Shape space was proposed over 20 years ago as a conceptual formalism in which to represent antibody/antigen binding. It has since played a key role in computational immunology. Antigens and antibodies are considered to be points in an abstract "shape space", where coordinates of points in this space represent generalized physico-chemical properties associated with various (unspecified) physical properties related to binding, such as geometric shape, hydrophobicity, charge, etc. Distances in shape space between points representing antibodies and (the shape complement) of antigens are assumed to be related to their affinity, with small distances corresponding to high affinity. In this paper, we provide algorithms, related to metric and ordinal multidimensional scaling algorithms first developed in the mathematical psychology literature, which construct explicit, quantitative coordinates for points in shape space given experimental data such as hemagglutination inhibition assays, or other general affinity assays. Previously, such coordinates had been conceptual constructs and totally implicit. The dimension of shape space deduced from hemagglutination inhibition assays for influenza is low, approximately five dimensional. The deduction of the explicit geometry of shape space given experimental affinity data provides new ways to quantify the similarity of antibodies to antibodies, antigens to antigens, and the affinity of antigens to antibodies. This has potential utility in, e.g. strain selection decisions for annual influenza vaccines, among other applications. The analysis techniques presented here are not restricted to the analysis of antibody-antigen interactions and are generally applicable to affinity data resulting from binding assays.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antigenic characterization of influenza viruses is typically based on hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay data for viral isolates tested against strain-specific postinfection ferret antisera. Here, similar virus characterizations were performed using serological data from humans with primary influenza A(H3N2) infection.
METHODS: We screened sera collected between 1995 and 2011 from children between 9 and 24 months of age for influenza virus antibodies, performed HI tests for the positive sera against 23 influenza viruses isolated between 1989 and 2011, and measured HI titers of antisera against influenza A(H3N2) from 24 ferrets against the same panel of viruses.
RESULTS: Of the 17 positive human sera, 6 had a high response, showing HI patterns that would be expected from primary infection antisera, while 11 sera had lower, more dispersed patterns of reactivity that are not easily explained. The antigenic map based on the high-response human HI data was similar to the map created using ferret data.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall structure of the ferret and human antigenic maps is similar, local differences in virus positions indicate that the human and ferret immune system might see antigenic properties of viruses differently. Further studies are needed to establish the degree of similarity between serological patterns in ferret and human data.},

Although there was remarkable correspondence between antigenic and genetic evolution, significant differences were observed: Antigenic evolution was more punctuated than genetic evolution, and genetic change sometimes had a disproportionately large antigenic effect. The method readily allows monitoring of antigenic differences among vaccine and circulating strains and thus estimation of the effects of vaccination. Further, this approach offers a route to predicting the relative success of emerging strains, which could be achieved by quantifying the combined effects of population level immune escape and viral fitness on strain evolution.},

We modelled the peak timing of influenza activity for 125 countries using laboratory-based surveillance data from the WHO's FLUNET database and compared it with the influenza hemispheric recommendations in place. Influenza vaccine recommendations for respectively 25% and 39% of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere countries were out of phase with peak influenza circulation in their corresponding hemisphere (62% and 53%, respectively, when the analysis was limited to the 52 countries in the tropical belt). These results indicate that routine influenza immunization efforts should be closely tailored to local patterns of viral circulation, rather than a country's hemispheric position. },

	Abstract = {Background
We used data provided by the Spanish influenza surveillance system to measure seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended cases, laboratory confirmed with the predominately circulating influenza virus over eight seasons (2003--2011).
Methods
Using the test-negative case-control design, we compared the vaccination status of swabbed influenza-like illnesses (ILI) patients who were laboratory confirmed with predominantly circulating influenza strain in the season (cases) to that of ILI patients testing negative for any influenza (controls). Data on age, sex, vaccination status and laboratory results were available for all seasons. We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted influenza VE for age, week of swabbing, Spanish region and season. We calculated the influenza VE by each season and pooling the seasons with the same predominant type/subtype.
Results
Overall influenza VE against infection with A(H3N2) subtype (four seasons) was 31 (95% confidence interval (CI):10; 48). For seasonal influenza A(H1N1) (two seasons), the effectiveness was 86% (95% CI: 65; 94). Against B infection (three seasons), influenza VE was 47% (95% CI: 27; 62).
Conclusions
The Spanish influenza surveillance system allowed estimating influenza VE in the studied seasons for the predominant strain. Strengthening the influenza surveillance will result in more precise VE estimates for decision making.},

	Abstract = {Background Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) is generally interpreted in the context of vaccine match/mismatch to circulating strains with evolutionary drift in the latter invoked to explain reduced protection. During the 2012--13 season, however, detailed genotypic and phenotypic characterization shows that low VE was instead related to mutations in the egg-adapted H3N2 vaccine strain rather than antigenic drift in circulating viruses.  Methods/Findings Component-specific VE against medically-attended, PCR-confirmed influenza was estimated in Canada by test-negative case-control design. Influenza A viruses were characterized genotypically by amino acid (AA) sequencing of established haemagglutinin (HA) antigenic sites and phenotypically through haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. H3N2 viruses were characterized in relation to the WHO-recommended, cell-passaged vaccine prototype (A/Victoria/361/2011) as well as the egg-adapted strain as per actually used in vaccine production. Among the total of 1501 participants, influenza virus was detected in 652 (43%). Nearly two-thirds of viruses typed/subtyped were A(H3N2) (394/626; 63%); the remainder were A(H1N1)pdm09 (79/626; 13%), B/Yamagata (98/626; 16%) or B/Victoria (54/626; 9%). Suboptimal VE of 50% (95%CI: 33--63%) overall was driven by predominant H3N2 activity for which VE was 41% (95%CI: 17--59%). All H3N2 field isolates were HI-characterized as well-matched to the WHO-recommended A/Victoria/361/2011 prototype whereas all but one were antigenically distinct from the egg-adapted strain as per actually used in vaccine production. The egg-adapted strain was itself antigenically distinct from the WHO-recommended prototype, and bore three AA mutations at antigenic sites B [H156Q, G186V] and D [S219Y]. Conversely, circulating viruses were identical to the WHO-recommended prototype at these positions with other genetic variation that did not affect antigenicity. VE was 59% (95%CI:16--80%) against A(H1N1)pdm09, 67% (95%CI: 30--85%) against B/Yamagata (vaccine-lineage) and 75% (95%CI: 29--91%) against B/Victoria (non-vaccine-lineage) viruses.  Conclusions These findings underscore the need to monitor vaccine viruses as well as circulating strains to explain vaccine performance. Evolutionary drift in circulating viruses cannot be regulated, but influential mutations introduced as part of egg-based vaccine production may be amenable to improvements.},

@article{Ohmit:2014,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Each year, the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network examines the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in preventing medically attended acute respiratory illnesses caused by influenza.
METHODS: Patients with acute respiratory illnesses of ≤ 7 days' duration were enrolled at ambulatory care facilities in 5 communities. Specimens were collected and tested for influenza by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Receipt of influenza vaccine was defined based on documented evidence of vaccination in medical records or immunization registries. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated in adjusted logistic regression models by comparing the vaccination coverage in those who tested positive for influenza with those who tested negative.
RESULTS: The 2011-2012 season was mild and peaked late, with circulation of both type A viruses and both lineages of type B. Overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36-56) in preventing medically attended influenza; vaccine effectiveness was 65% (95% CI, 44-79) against type A (H1N1) pdm09 but only 39% (95% CI, 23-52) against type A (H3N2). Estimates of vaccine effectiveness against both type B lineages were similar (overall, 58%; 95% CI, 35-73). An apparent negative effect of prior year vaccination on current year effectiveness estimates was noted, particularly for A (H3N2) outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine effectiveness in the 2011-2012 season was modest overall, with lower effectiveness against the predominant A (H3N2) virus. This may be related to antigenic drift, but past history of vaccination might also play a role.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the 2010-2011 winter, a large number of outbreaks due to influenza A/H3N2 at long-term care facilities, including higher-than-expected attack rates among vaccinated staff, were reported in some regions of Canada. Interim analysis from the community-based sentinel surveillance system showed circulating H3N2 variants and suboptimal vaccine effectiveness (VE), assessed here for the entire season's data set.
METHODS: Nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs and epidemiologic details were collected from patients presenting to sentinel sites within 7 days of onset of influenza-like illness. Cases tested positive for influenza by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; controls tested negative. Odds ratios for medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza in vaccinated vs nonvaccinated participants were used to derive adjusted VE. Viruses were characterized by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and the hemagglutinin genes of a subset were sequenced to explore vaccine relatedness.
RESULTS: Final 2010-2011 VE analysis included 1718 participants (half aged 20-49 years), 93 with A(H1N1)pdm09, 408 with A/H3N2, and 199 with influenza B. Among adults aged 20-49 years, adjusted VE was 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8%-87%) for A(H1N1)pdm09 and 66% (95% CI, 10%-87%) for influenza B. Vaccine effectiveness was substantially lower for A/H3N2, at 39% (95% CI, 0%-63%). Phylogenetic analysis identified 2 circulating H3N2 variant clades, A/HongKong/2121/2010 (87%) and A/Victoria/208/2009 (11%), bearing multiple amino acid substitutions at antigenic sites (12 and 8, respectively) compared with the H3N2 vaccine component used in Canada (A/Victoria/210/2009[NYMC X-187]). However, HI characterized all H3N2 isolates as well matched to the vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: Public health observations of increased facility H3N2 outbreaks were consistent with the sentinel network's detection of genetic variants and suboptimal VE but not with conventional HI characterization. We highlight the utility of a multicomponent sentinel surveillance platform that incorporates genotypic, phenotypic, and epidemiologic indicators into the assessment of influenza virus, new variant circulation, vaccine relatedness, and VE.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The analysis of epidemic influenza virus has been focused on antigenic and genomic characterization of the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein in order to detect new variants for the recommendation of the vaccine strains in each season. Since October 1998, WHO organized a second meeting to evaluate the vaccine formula for the southern hemisphere.
OBJECTIVES: (a) Present the antigenic and genomic characterization of influenza strains obtained from the Argentina surveillance network, (b) compare between strains collected in Argentina and other countries with the vaccine formula strains used in each season.
STUDY DESIGN: Influenza strains were collected during a 5-year period (1995-1999). Initially, laboratory diagnosis was done by immunofluorescence (IF) assay on clinical samples, followed by viral isolation in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The isolates were characterized antigenically by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay with post-infection ferret antisera. The genomic characterization consisted on RT-PCR followed by sequencing of the HA1 portion of the HA gene. The comparison between reference and circulating strains was analyzed by the construction of phylogenetic trees.
RESULTS: The H3N2 circulating strains matched the corresponding vaccine component only in 1999, the first year when a vaccine recommended specifically for the southern hemisphere was used. Besides, H1N1 circulating strains matched the corresponding vaccine component only in 1998. Regarding to influenza B, only in 1995, the circulating strains showed no match to the B vaccine component.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed the usefulness of an intensified influenza laboratory surveillance to access the correct vaccine and the importance of having the necessary tools to characterize the circulating strains.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Due to the lack of correlation from 1994 to 1997 between the A H3N2 component of the influenza vaccine recommended for this period and the circulating viruses in Argentina, we decided to study the antigenic and genomic relationships of the 1998 A H3N2 Argentine circulating strains with the corresponding vaccine component for that year as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
METHODS: We selected 18 influenza A H3N2 strains isolated in Argentina during 1998 to carry out an antigenic and genomic study of their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins. For the genomic study we added 3 isolates from Uruguay. We compared the Argentine and Uruguayan strains with available reference strains.
RESULTS: We found that all 18 strains from Argentina were similar to the A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) strain, as opposed to the A/Wuhan/359/95 (H3N2) strain, which was the vaccine component. This result was confirmed by the genomic study.
CONCLUSIONS: The approach that we applied in Argentina has improved the quality and quantity of information about influenza in the country. This type of work should be encouraged in other countries in order to help choose the most appropriate vaccine components each year and provide individuals with the best possible protection against influenza.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the similarity between influenza vaccine antigens and viruses associated with laboratory-confirmed infections by virus type/subtype, strain and influenza season; to correlate pneumonia and influenza hospitalization and mortality rates with the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza infections in an influenza season; and to develop predictive indicators of the likely incidence of current strains in the following season.
DESIGN: Ecological study using national laboratory, pneumonia and influenza hospitalization and mortality data.
SETTING: Canada, influenza seasons from 1980 to 1992.
POPULATION STUDIED: Individuals with laboratory-confirmed influenza infections, pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations or deaths.
INTERVENTION: Influenza immunization.
MAIN RESULTS: Similarity of circulating strains and vaccine antigens was 99% for A(H1N1), 65% for A(H3N2) and 65% for B strains. During outbreaks, pneumonia and influenza hospitalization, and mortality rates increased 19% or less and 21% or less for A(H1N1), respectively; 28% or less and 51% or less for A(H3N2), and 19% or less and 16% or less for B strains. There were usually fewer than 25 laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1) infections with a particular strain in a season if there had been more than 25 infections with similar strains the previous season. For A(H3N2), the figure was 100, and for B it was 150.
CONCLUSIONS: Matches were excellent for A(H1N1) and good for A(H3N2) plus B strains. Hospitalization and mortality rates increased substantially during outbreaks, eg, estimated 1609 excess deaths during a widespread A(H3N2) outbreak. This study identifies relationships that provide some ability to predict the incidence of a particular influenza strain in a coming season based on the incidence of strains similar to it in the previous season.},

	Abstract = {Data on the burden of disease and circulation patterns of influenza B lineages for Brazil are limited. This review aims to describe the pattern of influenza B occurrence in Brazil to have a better understanding of its epidemiology and its relevance when considering seasonal influenza vaccine composition. A review of the data including analysis of international and local surveillance data as well as information from online search of databases using Medical Subject Headings terms in conjunction with screening of abstracts from scientific events was performed. Based on international epidemiologic surveillance data, moderate levels of influenza B disease (19%; 2006-2014) were observed. Of these nine years, it was possible to compare data from three years (2007, 2008 and 2013) which have information on the circulating influenza B lineage. Co-circulation of influenza B lineages was observed in all these three influenza seasons, of which, during one season, a high degree of mismatch between the vaccine lineage and the predominant circulating lineage (91.4% [2013]) was observed. Local surveillance data reveal a distinct and dynamic distribution of respiratory viruses over the years. Data from published literature and abstracts show that influenza B is a significant cause of disease with an unpredictable circulation pattern and showing trends indicating reemergence of the B/Victoria lineage. The abstracts report notable levels of co-circulation of both influenza B lineages (2000-2013). Mismatch between the Southern hemisphere vaccine and the most prevalent circulating viruses in Brazil were observed in five influenza seasons. The evidence on co-circulation of two influenza B lineages and mismatched seasons in Brazil indicates the benefit of quadrivalent influenza vaccines in conferring broader seasonal influenza protection. Additionally, improving influenza surveillance platforms in Brazil is important for monitoring disease trends and the impact of introducing seasonal influenza vaccination. },

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Influenza B viruses are antigenically classified into Yamagata and Victoria lineages according to their hemagglutinin (HA) proteins. These two lineages are known to either appear sequentially or cocirculate in Taiwan.
METHODS: Taiwanese influenza B viral HA and neuraminidase (NA) sequences between 2003 and 2014 were determined and analyzed. A time-scaled phylogenetic tree was constructed to decipher the evolutionary trends of these sequences, and the reassortment between the two lineages. Positively selected amino acids were predicted, demonstrating the adaptive mutations of the circulating pattern.
RESULTS: The HA phylogenetic tree revealed that the Victoria lineage evolved into a ladder-like pattern, whereas the Yamagata lineage exhibited complex topology with several independently evolved clades on which viruses from different influenza seasons interlaced. For several seasons, HA sequences were found to be dominated by strains of the same lineage as the corresponding vaccine strain. Inspecting these sequences revealed that frequent mutations occurred in neutralizing epitopes and glycosylation sites. Amino acid positions 212 and 214 of N-glycosylation sites, which are known to be critical determinants of receptor-binding specificity, were found to be subject to positive selection. No drug-resistant sites were noticed in the NA sequences. In addition, we identified several cases of NA reassortment with an overall incidence rate of 6% for the investigated Taiwan strains.
CONCLUSION: We highlighted the interplay between mutations in the glycosylation sites and epitope during HA evolution. These are crucial molecular signatures to be monitored for influenza B epidemics in the future.},

@article{Campbell:2019aa,
	Abstract = {There exists significant interest in developing statistical and computational tools for inferring 'who infected whom' in an infectious disease outbreak from densely sampled case data, with most recent studies focusing on the analysis of whole genome sequence data. However, genomic data can be poorly informative of transmission events if mutations accumulate too slowly to resolve individual transmission pairs or if there exist multiple pathogens lineages within-host, and there has been little focus on incorporating other types of outbreak data. We present here a methodology that uses contact data for the inference of transmission trees in a statistically rigorous manner, alongside genomic data and temporal data. Contact data is frequently collected in outbreaks of pathogens spread by close contact, including Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and routinely used to reconstruct transmission chains. As an improvement over previous, ad-hoc approaches, we developed a probabilistic model that relates a set of contact data to an underlying transmission tree and integrated this in the outbreaker2 inference framework. By analyzing simulated outbreaks under various contact tracing scenarios, we demonstrate that contact data significantly improves our ability to reconstruct transmission trees, even under realistic limitations on the coverage of the contact tracing effort and the amount of non-infectious mixing between cases. Indeed, contact data is equally or more informative than fully sampled whole genome sequence data in certain scenarios. We then use our method to analyze the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore and describe the range of transmission scenarios consistent with contact data and genetic sequence in a probabilistic manner for the first time. This simple yet flexible model can easily be incorporated into existing tools for outbreak reconstruction and should permit a better integration of genomic and epidemiological data for inferring transmission chains.},

	Abstract = {{Surveillance data used by epidemic alert systems are typically fully aggregated in space at the national level. However, epidemics may be spatially heterogeneous, undergoing distinct dynamics in distinct regions of the surveillance area. We unveiled this in retrospective analyses by classifying incidence time series. We used Pearson correlation to quantify the similarity between local time series and then classified them using modularity maximization. The surveillance area was thus divided into regions with different incidence patterns. We analyzed 31 years (1985--2016) of data on influenza-like illness from the French Sentinelles system and found spatial heterogeneity in 19 of 31 influenza seasons. However, distinct epidemic regions could be identified only 4--5 weeks after a nationwide alert. The impact of spatial heterogeneity on influenza epidemiology was complex. First, when a nationwide alert was triggered, 32\\%--41\\% of the administrative regions of France were experiencing an epidemic, while the others were not. Second, the nationwide alert was timely for the whole surveillance area, but subsequently regions experienced distinct epidemic dynamics. Third, the epidemic dynamics were homogeneous in space. Spatial heterogeneity analyses can provide information on the timing of the peak and end of the epidemic, in various regions, for use in tailoring disease monitoring and control.}},

	Abstract = {To prevent new infections with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in sub-Saharan Africa, UNAIDS recommends targeting interventions to populations that are at high risk of acquiring and passing on the virus. Yet it is often unclear who and where these `source'populations are. Here we demonstrate how viral deep-sequencing can be used to reconstruct HIV-1 transmission networks and to infer the direction of transmission in these networks. We are able to deep-sequence virus from a large population-based sample of infected individuals in Rakai District, Uganda, reconstruct partial transmission networks, and infer the direction of transmission within them at an estimated error rate of 16.3{\%} {$[$}8.8--28.3{\%}{$]$}. With this error rate, deep-sequence phylogenetics cannot be used against individuals in legal contexts, but is sufficiently low for population-level inferences into the sources of epidemic spread. The technique presents new opportunities for characterizing source populations and for targeting of HIV-1 prevention interventions in Africa.},

	Abstract = {Human mobility is an important driver of geographic spread of infectious pathogens. Detailed information about human movements during outbreaks are, however, difficult to obtain and may not be available during future epidemics. The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa between 2014--16 demonstrated how quickly pathogens can spread to large urban centers following one cross-species transmission event. Here we describe a flexible transmission model to test the utility of generalised human movement models in estimating EVD cases and spatial spread over the course of the outbreak. A transmission model that includes a general model of human mobility significantly improves prediction of EVD's incidence compared to models without this component. Human movement plays an important role not only to ignite the epidemic in locations previously disease free, but over the course of the entire epidemic. We also demonstrate important differences between countries in population mixing and the improved prediction attributable to movement metrics. Given their relative rareness, locally derived mobility data are unlikely to exist in advance of future epidemics or pandemics. Our findings show that transmission patterns derived from general human movement models can improve forecasts of spatio-temporal transmission patterns in places where local mobility data is unavailable.},

@article{EKSIN2019,
	Abstract = {In a simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, the initial speed at which infected cases increase is indicative of the long-term trajectory of the outbreak. Yet during real-world outbreaks, individuals may modify their behavior and take preventative steps to reduce infection risk. As a consequence, the relationship between the initial rate of spread and the final case count may become tenuous. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis by comparing the dynamics arising from a simple SIR epidemic model with those from a modified SIR model in which individuals reduce contacts as a function of the current or cumulative number of cases. Dynamics with behavior change exhibit significantly reduced final case counts even though the initial speed of disease spread is nearly identical for both of the models. We show that this difference in final size projections depends critically in the behavior change of individuals. These results also provide a rationale for integrating behavior change into iterative forecast models. Hence, we propose to use a Kalman filter to update models with and without behavior change as part of iterative forecasts. When the ground truth outbreak includes behavior change, sequential predictions using a simple SIR model perform poorly despite repeated observations while predictions using the modified SIR model are able to correct for initial forecast errors. These findings highlight the value of incorporating behavior change into baseline epidemic and dynamic forecast models.},

	Abstract = {{To develop a more effective vaccination strategy for reducing the impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, especially in young infants (\\&lt;6 months old), it is necessary to understand the transmission dynamics of RSV.We conducted a community-based prospective cohort study from 2014 to 2016 in Biliran Province, the Philippines, on children \\&lt;5 years old. We collected nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) during household visits and at health facilities. In households (n = 181) with RSV-positive ARI cases (RSV-ARI), we also identified ARI episodes among other children \\&lt;5 years old in the same household. In addition, we determined the serial interval to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0), the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case.In the 181 households analyzed, we found 212 RSV-ARI in 152 households with a single case and 29 households with multiple cases, which included 29 1st RSV-ARI and 31 2nd RSV-ARI. We also found possible index cases among children \\&lt;5 years old in the same household for 29.0\\% (18 of 62) of young infants with RSV-ARI. The estimated mean serial interval was 3.2 days, and R0 was estimated to be 0.92--1.33 for RSV-A and 1.04--1.76 for RSV-B, which varied between different times (2014 and 2015) and places.Young infants are likely to acquire RSV infection from older children in the same household. Therefore, vaccination targeting older children might protect infants from RSV infection.}},

	Abstract = {The fractional coalescent is a generalization of Kingman{\textquoteright}s n-coalescent. It facilitates the development of the theory of population genetic processes that deviate from Poisson-distributed waiting times. It also marks the use of methods developed in fractional calculus in population genetics. The fractional coalescent is an extension of Canning{\textquoteright}s model, where the variance of the number of offspring per parent is a random variable. The distribution of the number of offspring depends on a parameter α, which is a potential measure of the environmental heterogeneity that is commonly ignored in current inferences.An approach to the coalescent, the fractional coalescent (f-coalescent), is introduced. The derivation is based on the discrete-time Cannings population model in which the variance of the number of offspring depends on the parameter α. This additional parameter α affects the variability of the patterns of the waiting times; values of α\&lt;1 lead to an increase of short time intervals, but occasionally allow for very long time intervals. When α=1, the f-coalescent and the Kingman{\textquoteright}s n-coalescent are equivalent. The distribution of the time to the most recent common ancestor and the probability that n genes descend from m ancestral genes in a time interval of length T for the f-coalescent are derived. The f-coalescent has been implemented in the population genetic model inference software Migrate. Simulation studies suggest that it is possible to accurately estimate α values from data that were generated with known α values and that the f-coalescent can detect potential environmental heterogeneity within a population. Bayes factor comparisons of simulated data with α\&lt;1 and real data (H1N1 influenza and malaria parasites) showed an improved model fit of the f-coalescent over the n-coalescent. The development of the f-coalescent and its inclusion into the inference program Migrate facilitates testing for deviations from the n-coalescent.},

	Abstract = {Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a globally increasing public health problem. Mathematical models, carefully matched to available epidemiological and behavioural data, have an important role to play in predicting the action of control measures. Here, we explore the effect of concurrent sexual partnerships on the control of a generic STI with susceptible-infected-susceptible dynamics. Concurrency refers to being in more than one sexual partnership at the same time, and is difficult to measure accurately. We assess the impact of concurrency through the development of three nested pair-formation models: one where infection can only be transmitted via stable sexual partnerships, one where infection can also be transmitted via casual partnerships between single individuals, and one where those individuals in stable partnerships can also acquire infection from casual partnerships. For each model, we include the action of vaccination before sexual debut to inform about the ability to control. As expected, for a fixed transmission rate, concurrency increases both the endemic prevalence of infection and critical level of vaccination required to eliminate the disease significantly. However, when the transmission rate is scaled to maintain a fixed endemic prevalence across models, concurrency has a far smaller impact upon the critical level of vaccination required. Further, when we also constrain the models to have a fixed number of new partnerships over time (both long-term and casual), then increasing concurrency can slightly decrease the critical level of vaccination. These results highlight that accurate measures and models of concurrency may not always be needed for reliable forecasts when models are closely matched to prevalence data. We find that, while increases in concurrency within a population are likely to generate public-health problems, the inclusion of concurrency may be unnecessary when constructing models to determine the efficacy of the control of STIs by vaccination.},

	Abstract = {From August to November 2017, Madagascar endured an outbreak of plague. A total of 2417 cases of plague were confirmed, causing a death toll of 209. Public health intervention efforts were introduced and successfully stopped the epidemic at the end of November. The plague, however, is endemic in the region and occurs annually, posing the risk of future outbreaks. To understand the plague transmission, we collected real-time data from official reports, described the outbreak's characteristics, and estimated transmission parameters using statistical and mathematical models. The pneumonic plague epidemic curve exhibited multiple peaks, coinciding with sporadic introductions of new bubonic cases. Optimal climate conditions for rat flea to flourish were observed during the epidemic. Estimate of the plague basic reproduction number during the large wave of the epidemic was high, ranging from 5 to 7 depending on model assumptions. The incubation and infection periods for bubonic and pneumonic plague were 4.3 and 3.4 days and 3.8 and 2.9 days, respectively. Parameter estimation suggested that even with a small fraction of the population exposed to infected rat fleas (1/10,000) and a small probability of transition from a bubonic case to a secondary pneumonic case (3%), the high human-to-human transmission rate can still generate a large outbreak. Controlling rodent and fleas can prevent new index cases, but managing human-to-human transmission is key to prevent large-scale outbreaks.},

	Abstract = {In the 2013-2016 west Africa outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), most of the planned clinical trials failed to reach a conclusion within the time frame of the epidemic. The performance of clinical trial designs for the evaluation of one or more experimental treatments in the specific context of an ongoing epidemic with changing case fatality rates (CFR) and unpredictable case numbers is unclear. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of commonly used two- and multi-arm clinical trial designs based on real data, which was recorded during the 2013-16 EVD epidemic in west Africa. The primary endpoint is death within 14 days of hospitalization. The impact of the recruitment start times relative to the time course of the epidemic on the operating characteristics of the clinical trials is analysed. Designs with frequent interim analyses with the possibility of early stopping are shown to outperform designs with only a single analysis not only in terms of average time to conclusion and average sample size, but also in terms of the probability of reaching any conclusion at all. Historic control designs almost always result in substantially inflated false positive rates, when the case fatality rate changes over time. Response-adaptive randomization may be a compromise between the goal of scientific validity and the ethical goal of minimizing the number of patients allocated to ineffective treatments.},

	Abstract = {Vaccination is an important intervention to prevent influenza virus infection, but indirect protection of household members of vaccinees is not fully known. Here, we analyze a cluster household randomized controlled trial, with one child in each household randomized to receive influenza vaccine or placebo, for an influenza B epidemic in Hong Kong. We apply statistical models to estimate household transmission dynamics and quantify the direct and indirect protection of vaccination. Direct vaccine efficacy was 71%. The infection probability of unvaccinated household members in vaccinated households was only 5% lower than in control households, because only 10% of infections are attributed to household transmission. Even when that proportion rises to 30% and all children are vaccinated, we predict that the infection probability for unvaccinated household members would only be reduced by 20%. This suggests that benefits of individual vaccination remain important even when other household members are vaccinated.},

	Abstract = {Bayesian methods have been used to predict the timing of infectious disease epidemics in various settings and for many infectious diseases, including seasonal influenza. But integrating these techniques into public health practice remains an ongoing challenge, and requires close collaboration between modellers, epidemiologists, and public health staff.
During the 2016 and 2017 Australian influenza seasons, weekly seasonal influenza forecasts were produced for cities in the three states with the largest populations: Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. Forecast results were presented to Health Department disease surveillance units in these jurisdictions, who provided feedback about the plausibility and public health utility of these predictions.
In earlier studies we found that delays in reporting and processing of surveillance data substantially limited forecast performance, and that incorporating climatic effects on transmission improved forecast performance. In this study of the 2016 and 2017 seasons, we sought to refine the forecasting method to account for delays in receiving the data, and used meteorological data from past years to modulate the force of infection. We demonstrate how these refinements improved the forecast's predictive capacity, and use the 2017 influenza season to highlight challenges in accounting for population and clinician behaviour changes in response to a severe season.},

	Abstract = {Accurate forecasting of seasonal influenza epidemics is of great concern to healthcare providers in temperate climates, since these epidemics vary substantially in their size, timing and duration from year to year, making it a challenge to deliver timely and proportionate responses. Previous studies have shown that Bayesian estimation techniques can accurately predict when an influenza epidemic will peak many weeks in advance, and we have previously tailored these methods for metropolitan Melbourne (Australia) and Google Flu Trends data. Here we extend these methods to clinical observation and laboratory-confirmation data for Melbourne, on the grounds that these data sources provide more accurate characterizations of influenza activity. We show that from each of these data sources we can accurately predict the timing of the epidemic peak 4-6 weeks in advance. We also show that making simultaneous use of multiple surveillance systems to improve forecast skill remains a fundamental challenge. Disparate systems provide complementary characterizations of disease activity, which may or may not be comparable, and it is unclear how a 'ground truth' for evaluating forecasts against these multiple characterizations might be defined. These findings are a significant step towards making optimal use of routine surveillance data for outbreak forecasting.},

	Abstract = {Vaccination remains the most successful and effective mechanism of pathogen control. However, their development and deployment in epidemic settings have been limited, and the 2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa identified several bottlenecks linked to a lack of investment in pathogen research, infrastructure or regulation. Shortly after this outbreak, the UK Government established the UK Vaccine Network to ensure the UK is better prepared to respond to pathogens outbreaks of epidemic potential. As part of their work, the network commissioned the creation of a Vaccine Development Tool (http://www.vaccinedevelopment.org.uk/) to serve as a guide to the key stages in vaccine development. The tool also set out to capture the key, rate-limiting bottlenecks in the development of vaccines against emerging infectious disease such that corrective action could be taken, be it through research, funding, infrastructure and policy, both in the UK and internationally. The main research bottlenecks were related to understanding pathogen biology, identification of appropriate animal models and investment in the manufacturing sciences, especially into process development. Infrastructure gaps in GMP manufacturing and fill-finish were also identified and limitations in GMO regulation and regulatory and ethical approvals, especially for outbreak pathogens required new policy initiatives. The UK Vaccine Network has since begun work to correct for these limitations with a series of funding calls and development programmes. This paper seeks to summarise the Vaccine Development Tool and its key findings.},

	Abstract = {{Much of the intellectual tradition of modern epidemiology stems from efforts to understand and combat chronic diseases persisting through the 20th century epidemiologic transition of countries such as the United States and United Kingdom. Following decades of relative obscurity, infectious disease epidemiology has undergone an intellectual rebirth in recent years amid increasing recognition of the threat posed by both new and familiar pathogens. Here we review the emerging coalescence of infectious disease epidemiology around a core set of study designs and statistical methods bearing little resemblance to the chronic disease epidemiology toolkit. We offer our outlook on challenges and opportunities facing the field, including the integration of novel molecular and digital information sources into disease surveillance, the assimilation of such data into models of pathogen spread, and the increasing contribution of models to public health practice. We next consider emerging paradigms in causal inference for infectious diseases, ranging from approaches to evaluating vaccines and antimicrobial therapies to the task of ascribing clinical syndromes to etiologic microorganisms, an age-old problem transformed by our increasing ability to characterize human-associated microbiota. These areas represent an increasingly important component of epidemiology training programs for future generations of researchers and practitioners.}},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE An estimated 293,300 healthcare-associated cases of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) occur annually in the United States. To date, research has focused on developing risk prediction models for CDI that work well across institutions. However, this one-size-fits-all approach ignores important hospital-specific factors. We focus on a generalizable method for building facility-specific models. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach using electronic health records (EHR) from the University of Michigan Hospitals (UM) and the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). METHODS We utilized EHR data from 191,014 adult admissions to UM and 65,718 adult admissions to MGH. We extracted patient demographics, admission details, patient history, and daily hospitalization details, resulting in 4,836 features from patients at UM and 1,837 from patients at MGH. We used L2 regularized logistic regression to learn the models, and we measured the discriminative performance of the models on held-out data from each hospital. RESULTS Using the UM and MGH test data, the models achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.84) and 0.75 ( 95% CI, 0.73-0.78), respectively. Some predictive factors were shared between the 2 models, but many of the top predictive factors differed between facilities. CONCLUSION A data-driven approach to building models for estimating daily patient risk for CDI was used to build institution-specific models at 2 large hospitals with different patient populations and EHR systems. In contrast to traditional approaches that focus on developing models that apply across hospitals, our generalizable approach yields risk-stratification models tailored to an institution. These hospital-specific models allow for earlier and more accurate identification of high-risk patients and better targeting of infection prevention strategies.

@article{Sethi:2010aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for control of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) suggest that contact precautions be discontinued after diarrhea resolves. However, limited information is available regarding the frequency of skin contamination and environmental shedding of C. difficile during and after treatment.
DESIGN: We conducted a 9-month prospective, observational study involving 52 patients receiving therapy for CDI. Stool samples, skin (chest and abdomen) samples, and samples from environmental sites were cultured for C. difficile before, during, and after treatment. Polymerase chain reaction ribotyping was performed to determine the relatedness of stool, skin, and environmental isolates.
RESULTS: Fifty-two patients with CDI were studied. C. difficile was suppressed to undetectable levels in stool samples from most patients during treatment; however, 1-4 weeks after treatment, 56% of patients who had samples tested were asymptomatic carriers of C. difficile. The frequencies of skin contamination and environmental shedding remained high at the time of resolution of diarrhea (60% and 37%, respectively), were lower at the end of treatment (32% and 14%, respectively), and again increased 1-4 weeks after treatment (58% and 50%, respectively). Skin and environmental contamination after treatment was associated with use of antibiotics for non-CDI indications. Ninety-four percent of skin isolates and 82% of environmental isolates were genetically identical to concurrent stool isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: Skin contamination and environmental shedding of C. difficile often persist at the time of resolution of diarrhea, and recurrent shedding is common 1-4 weeks after therapy. These results provide support for the recommendation that contact precautions be continued until hospital discharge if rates of CDI remain high despite implementation of standard infection-control measures.},

@article{Volz:2018,
	Abstract = {Population genetic modeling can enhance Bayesian phylogenetic inference by providing a realistic prior on the distribution of branch lengths and times of common ancestry. The parameters of a population genetic model may also have intrinsic importance, and simultaneous estimation of a phylogeny and model parameters has enabled phylodynamic inference of population growth rates, reproduction numbers, and effective population size through time. Phylodynamic inference based on pathogen genetic sequence data has emerged as useful supplement to epidemic surveillance, however commonly-used mechanistic models that are typically fitted to non-genetic surveillance data are rarely fitted to pathogen genetic data due to a dearth of software tools, and the theory required to conduct such inference has been developed only recently. We present a framework for coalescent-based phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference which enables highly-flexible modeling of demographic and epidemiological processes. This approach builds upon previous structured coalescent approaches and includes enhancements for computational speed, accuracy, and stability. A flexible markup language is described for translating parametric demographic or epidemiological models into a structured coalescent model enabling simultaneous estimation of demographic or epidemiological parameters and time-scaled phylogenies. We demonstrate the utility of these approaches by fitting compartmental epidemiological models to Ebola virus and Influenza A virus sequence data, demonstrating how important features of these epidemics, such as the reproduction number and epidemic curves, can be gleaned from genetic data. These approaches are provided as an open-source package PhyDyn for the BEAST2 phylogenetics platform.},

	Abstract = {Previous molecular studies of Serbian HIV epidemic identified the dominance of subtype B and presence of clusters related HIV-1 transmission, in particular among men who have sex with men (MSM). In order to get deeper understanding of the complexities of HIV subepidemics in Serbia, epidemic trends, temporal origin and phylodinamic characteristics in general population and subpopulations were analyzed by means of mathematical modeling, phylogenetic analysis and latent class analysis (LCA). Fitting of the logistic curve of trends for cumulative annual number of new HIV cases in 1984-2016, in general population and MSMs was performed. Both datasets fitted the logistic growth model, showing early exponential phase of the growth curve. According to the suggested model, by the year 2030 the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases in Serbia will continue to grow, in particular in the MSMs. Further, detailed phylogenetic analysis was performed on 385 sequences from the period 1997-2015. Identification of transmission clusters, estimation of population growth (Ne), of the effective reproductive number (Re) and time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) was estimated employing Bayesian and Maximum likelihood methods. Substantial proportion of 53% of subtype B sequences was found within transmission clusters/network. Phylodynamic analysis revealed Re over one during the whole investigated period, with the steepest slopes and a recent tMRCA for MSM subtype B clades, in line with a growing trend in the number of transmissions in years approaching the end of the study period. Contrary, heterosexual clades in both studied subtypes -- B and C, showed modest growth and stagnation. LCA analysis identified five latent classes, with transmission clusters dominantly present in 2/5 classes, linked to MSMs living in the capital city and with high prevalence of coinfection with HBV and/or other STIs.
Presented findings imply that HIV epidemic in Serbia is still in the exponential growth phase, in particular related to the MSM transmission, with estimated steep growing curve until 2030. The obtained results imply that an average new HIV patient in Serbia is a young man with concomitant sexually transmitted infection.},

@article{Torneri:2019aa,
	Abstract = {One of the key characteristics of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is the generation time which refers to the time interval between the infection of a secondary case and the infection of its infector. The generation time distribution together with the reproduction number determines the rate at which an infection spreads in a population. When defining the generation time distribution at a calendar time t two definitions are plausible according whether we regard t as the infection time of the infector or the infection time of the infectee. The resulting measurements are respectively called forward generation time and backward generation time. It has been observed that the mean forward generation time contracts around the peak of an epidemic. This contraction effect has previously been attributed to either competition among potential infectors or depletion of susceptibles in the population. The first explanation requires many infectives for contraction to occur whereas the latter explanation suggests that contraction occurs even when there are few infectives. With a simulation study we show that both competition and depletion cause the mean forward generation time to contract. Our results also reveal that the distribution of the infectious period and the reproduction number have a strong effect on the size and timing of the contraction, as well as on the mean value of the generation time in both forward and backward scheme.Author summary Infectious diseases remain one of the greatest threats to human health and commerce, and the analysis of epidemic data is one of the most important applications of statistics in public health. Thus, having reliable estimates of fundamental infectious diseases parameters is critical for public health decision-makers in order to take appropriate actions for the global prevention and management of outbreaks and other health emergencies. A key example is given by the prediction models of the reproduction numbers: these rely on the generation time distribution that is usually estimated from contact tracing data collected at a precise calendar time. The forward scheme is used in such a prediction model and the knowledge of its evolution over time is crucial to correctly estimate the parameters of interest. It is therefore important to characterize the causes that lead to the contraction of the mean forward generation time during the course of an outbreak.In this paper, we firstly identify the impact of the epidemiological quantities as reproduction number, infectious period and population size on the mean forward and backward generation time. Moreover, we analyze the phenomena of competition among infectives and depletion of susceptible individuals highlighting their effects on the contraction of the mean forward generation time. The upshot of this investigation is that the variance of the infectious period distribution and the reproduction number have a strong impact on the generation times affecting both the mean value and the evolution over time. Furthermore, competition and depletion can both cause contraction even for small values of the reproduction number suggesting that, in epidemic models where the generation time is considered time-inhomogeneous, estimators accounting for both depletion and competing risks are to be preferred in the inference of the generation interval distributions.},

	Abstract = {{In the United States, it is recommended that healthcare providers offer influenza vaccination by October, if possible. However, if the vaccine's effectiveness soon begins to wane, the optimal time for vaccination may be somewhat later. We examined whether the effectiveness of influenza vaccine wanes during the influenza season with increasing time since vaccination.We identified persons who were vaccinated with inactivated influenza vaccine from 1 September 2010 to 31 March 2017 and who were subsequently tested for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by a polymerase chain reaction test. Test-confirmed influenza was the primary outcome and days-since-vaccination was the predictor of interest in conditional logistic regression. Models were adjusted for age and conditioned on calendar day and geographic area. RSV was used as a negative-control outcome.Compared with persons vaccinated 14 to 41 days prior to being tested, persons vaccinated 42 to 69 days prior to being tested had 1.32 (95\\% confidence interval [CI], 1.11 to 1.55) times the odds of testing positive for any influenza. The odds ratio (OR) increased linearly by approximately 16\\% for each additional 28 days since vaccination. The OR was 2.06 (95\\% CI, 1.69 to 2.51) for persons vaccinated 154 or more days prior to being tested. No evidence of waning was found for RSV.Our results suggest that effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine wanes during the course of a single season. These results may lead to reconsideration of the optimal timing of seasonal influenza vaccination.}},

	Abstract = {{There is a growing consensus on the need for better influenza vaccines to improve on the many shortcomings of existing vaccines. Current vaccines' effectiveness is modest in some years and undetectable for some viral (sub)types in others [1]. Antigenic changes in the influenza virus require changes in vaccine strain composition for at least 1 of the 3 viral (sub)types in most years, resulting in further uncertainty about how the new vaccine will perform. Moreover, studies, including that by Ray et al in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases [2], indicate that the immunity induced by inactivated flu vaccines may wane within months. Thus, those who follow public health advice to get vaccinated well before the winter influenza season may gain less benefit than those who do so later [3, 4]. In the new study, persons who received an influenza vaccination and later received a viral test for an acute respiratory infection were compared, calculating the odds of testing positive for influenza among those who were recently vaccinated at the time of their test to those who had been vaccinated months before. Ray et al found that the odds of testing positive for influenza increased by 16\\% per 28-days period between vaccination and testing. From this variant on the test-negative study design (see below) they inferred that vaccine-induced protection waned during 7 influenza seasons from 2010 to 2017.}},

	Abstract = {Seasonal influenza results in substantial annual morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. Accurate forecasts of key features of influenza epidemics, such as the timing and severity of the peak incidence in a given season, can inform public health response to outbreaks. As part of ongoing efforts to incorporate data and advanced analytical methods into public health decision-making, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has organized seasonal influenza forecasting challenges since the 2013/2014 season. In the 2017/2018 season, 22 teams participated. A subset of four teams created a research consortium called the FluSight Network in early 2017. During the 2017/2018 season they worked together to produce a collaborative multi-model ensemble that combined 21 separate component models into a single model using a machine learning technique called stacking. This approach creates a weighted average of predictive densities where the weight for each component is based on that component{\textquoteright}s forecast accuracy in past seasons. In the 2017/2018 influenza season, one of the largest seasonal outbreaks in the last 15 years, this multi-model ensemble performed better on average than all individual component models and placed second overall in the CDC challenge. It also outperformed the baseline multi-model ensemble created by the CDC that took a simple average of all models submitted to the forecasting challenge. This project shows that collaborative efforts between research teams to develop ensemble forecasting approaches can bring measurable improvements in forecast accuracy and important reductions in the variability of performance from year to year. Efforts such as this, that emphasize real-time testing and evaluation of forecasting models and facilitate the close collaboration between public health officials and modeling researchers, are essential to improving our understanding of how best to use forecasts to improve public health response to seasonal and emerging epidemic threats.},

	Abstract = {Objectives: A new variant of Chlamydia trachomatis (nvCT) was discovered in Sweden in late 2006. The nvCT has a plasmid deletion, which escaped detection by two nucleic acid amplification tests that were being used in 14 of 21 Swedish counties. The objectives of this study were to assess when and where nvCT emerged in Sweden, the proportion of nvCT in each county, and the role of a potential fitness difference between nvCT and the co-circulating wtCT strains. Methods: We used a compartmental mathematical model describing the spatial and temporal spread of nvCT and wtCT. We parameterised the model using sexual behaviour data and Swedish spatial and demographic data. We used Bayesian inference to fit the model to surveillance data about reported diagnoses of chlamydia infection in each county and data from four counties that assessed the proportion of nvCT in multiple years. Results: Model results indicated that nvCT emerged in central Sweden (Dalarna, G{\"a}vleborg, V{\"a}sternorrland), reaching a proportion of 1\% of prevalent CT infections in late 2002 or early 2003. The diagnostic selective advantage of nvCT enabled its rapid spread in the presence of high treatment rates. After detection, the proportion of nvCT decreased from 30-70\% in Abbott-Roche counties and 5-20\% in Becton Dickinson counties to around 5\% in 2015 in all counties. The decrease in nvCT was consistent with an estimated fitness cost of around 5\% in transmissibility or 17\% in infectious duration. Conclusions: We reconstructed the course of a natural experiment in which a mutant strain of C. trachomatis spread across Sweden. Our modelling study for the first time provides support of a reduced transmissibility or infectious duration of nvCT. The results of this mathematical model, incorporating epidemiological surveillance data, has improved our understanding of the epidemic caused by nvCT in Sweden.},

Parasitic diseases which increase the death rate of the hosts proportional to the integer number of parasites present were described by integral equations for the generating function of the age- and time-dependent number of parasites. A model was derived for a population structured by the continuous level of parasitic infection. Stimulated by the spread of AIDS a new class of epidemic models was developed which take into account explicitly the formation and separation of pairs. For predator-prey populations with parasitic infections threshold conditions for the persistence of the predator were derived. The interaction of epidemics and demography was analysed. Several epidemiological conditions led to backward bifurcations associated with multiple infective stationary states.},

Although case fatality models and differential mortality models are equivalent via a transformation in parameter space, the underlying ideas and the dynamic behaviors are different, e.g. the basic reproduction number depends on differential mortality but not on case fatality. The persistent distributions and exponents of growth of infected solutions are computed and discussed in terms of the parameters. The notion of asymptotically exponentially growing state (as opposed to stationary state or exponential solution) coined by Thieme is interpreted in terms of stability theory. Of some interest are limiting cases of models without recovery where two infected solutions exist.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phylogenetics has been used to investigate HIV transmission among men who have sex with men. This study compares several methodologies to elucidate the role of transmission chains in the dynamics of HIV spread in Quebec, Canada.
METHODS: The Quebec Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) genotyping program database now includes viral sequences from close to 4,000 HIV-positive individuals classified as Men who have Sex with Men (MSMs), collected between 1996 and early 2016. Assessment of chain expansion may depend on the partitioning scheme used, and so, we produce estimates from several methods: the conventional Bayesian and maximum likelihood-bootstrap methods, in combination with a variety of schemes for applying a maximum distance criterion, and two other algorithms, DM-PhyClus, a Bayesian algorithm that produces a measure of uncertainty for proposed partitions, and the Gap Procedure, a fast non-phylogenetic approach. Sequences obtained from individuals in the Primary HIV Infection (PHI) stage serve to identify incident cases. We focus on the period ranging from January 1st 2012 to February 1st 2016.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The analyses reveal considerable overlap between chain estimates obtained from conventional methods, thus leading to similar estimates of recent temporal expansion. The Gap Procedure and DM-PhyClus suggest however moderately different chains. Nevertheless, all estimates stress that longer older chains are responsible for a sizeable proportion of the sampled incident cases among MSMs. Curbing the HIV epidemic will require strategies aimed specifically at preventing such growth.},

	Abstract = {{Marginal effects can be used to express how the predicted probability of a binary outcome changes with a change in a risk factor. For example, how does 1-year mortality risk change with a 1-year increase in age or for a patient with diabetes compared with a patient without diabetes? This approach can make the results more easily understood. Marginal effects often are reported with logistic regression analyses to communicate and quantify the incremental risk associated with each factor.In a 2013 article in JAMA Psychiatry, Cummings et al studied factors that predicted access to outpatient mental health facilities that accept Medicaid. Their main outcome had 3 categories, which were labeled ``no access,'' ``some access,'' and ``good access.'' An ordered logistic regression model was developed and results were presented as the change in the probability of each outcome for a change in certain demographic factors.}},

	Abstract = {Can early warning systems be developed to predict influenza epidemics? Using Australian influenza surveillance and local internet search query data, this study investigated whether seasonal influenza epidemics in China, the US and the UK can be predicted using empirical time series analysis. Weekly national number of respiratory cases positive for influenza virus infection that were reported to the FluNet surveillance system in Australia, China, the US and the UK were obtained from World Health Organization FluNet surveillance between week 1, 2010, and week 9, 2018. We collected combined search query data for the US and the UK from Google Trends, and for China from Baidu Index. A multivariate seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model was developed to track influenza epidemics using Australian influenza and local search data. Parameter estimates for this model were generally consistent with the observed values. The inclusion of search metrics improved the performance of the model with high correlation coefficients (China = 0.96, the US = 0.97, the UK = 0.96, p < 0.01) and low Maximum Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) values (China = 16.76, the US = 96.97, the UK = 125.42). This study demonstrates the feasibility of combining (Australia) influenza and local search query data to predict influenza epidemics a different (northern hemisphere) scales.},

@article{Darbon:2019aa,
	Abstract = {The infectious period of a transmissible disease is a key factor for disease spread and persistence. Epidemic models on networks typically assume an identical average infectious period for all individuals, thus allowing an analytical treatment. This simplifying assumption is, however, often unrealistic, as hosts may have different infectious periods, due, for instance, to individual host-pathogen interactions or inhomogeneous access to treatment. While previous work accounted for this heterogeneity in static networks, a full theoretical understanding of the interplay of varying infectious periods and time-evolving contacts is still missing. Here, we consider a susceptible-infectious-susceptible epidemic on a temporal network with host-specific average infectious periods, and develop an analytical framework to estimate the epidemic threshold, i.e. the critical transmissibility for disease spread in the host population. Integrating contact data for transmission with outbreak data and epidemiological estimates, we apply our framework to three real-world case studies exploring different epidemic contexts-the persistence of bovine tuberculosis in southern Italy, the spread of nosocomial infections in a hospital, and the diffusion of pandemic influenza in a school. We find that the homogeneous parametrization may cause important biases in the assessment of the epidemic risk of the host population. Our approach is also able to identify groups of hosts mostly responsible for disease diffusion who may be targeted for prevention and control, aiding public health interventions.},

	Abstract = {{(See the Breif Report by Xia et al on pages 851--5.)Viral suppression in persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) saves lives and prevents new infections [1, 2]. Recently, the ``undetectable=untransmittable'' (U=U) concept has been embraced by community advocates and widely endorsed by scientific and public health agencies as a stigma-combating message grounded in rigorous science [3]. As the science behind U=U has fallen into place, so too has the drive to ensure that persons in which HIV infection has been newly diagnosed achieve viral suppression quickly. However, neither of the 2 flagship strategies guiding HIV prevention and care in the United States (the Joint United Nations Program on AIDS [UNAIDS] 90-90-90 targets [4] and the US National HIV/AIDS Strategy [NHAS] [5]) incorporates a time element. The numeric goals of UNAIDS and the NHAS---81\\% and 80\\% viral suppression, respectively, among persons with a diagnosis of HIV infection---measure only a cross-sectional snapshot of the population. Yet a person who reaches viral suppression within 1 month of diagnosis reflects a greater individual and public health success than one who reaches viral suppression 1 year after diagnosis.}},

	Abstract = {Seasonal influenza in the United States is estimated to cause 9--35 million illnesses annually, with resultant economic burden amounting to $47-$150 billion. Reliable real-time forecasts of influenza can help public health agencies better manage these outbreaks. Here, we investigate the feasibility of three autoregressive methods for near-term forecasts: an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model with time-varying order; an ARIMA model fit to seasonally adjusted incidence rates (ARIMA-STL); and a feed-forward autoregressive artificial neural network with a single hidden layer (AR-NN). We generated retrospective forecasts for influenza incidence one to four weeks in the future at US National and 10 regions in the US during 5 influenza seasons. We compared the relative accuracy of the point and probabilistic forecasts of the three models with respect to each other and in relation to two large external validation sets that each comprise at least 20 other models. Both the probabilistic and point forecasts of AR-NN were found to be more accurate than those of the other two models overall. An additional sub-analysis found that the three models benefitted considerably from the use of search trends based 'nowcast' as a proxy for surveillance data, and these three models with use of nowcasts were found to be the highest ranked models in both validation datasets. When the nowcasts were withheld, the three models remained competitive relative to models in the validation sets. The difference in accuracy among the three models, and relative to models of the validation sets, was found to be largely statistically significant. Our results suggest that autoregressive models even when not equipped to capture transmission dynamics can provide reasonably accurate near-term forecasts for influenza. Existing support in open-source libraries make them suitable non-na{\"\i}ve baselines for model comparison studies and for operational forecasts in resource constrained settings where more sophisticated methods may not be feasible.},

@article{Funk:2019,
	Abstract = {Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and bias of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time for Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but model predictions were increasingly unreliable at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making based on predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.},

	Abstract = {Monitoring a population for a disease requires the hosts to be sampled and tested for the pathogen. This results in sampling series from which to estimate the disease incidence, i.e. the proportion of hosts infected. Existing estimation methods assume that disease incidence is not changing between monitoring rounds, resulting in underestimation of the disease incidence. In this paper we develop an incidence estimation model accounting for epidemic growth with monitoring rounds sampling varying incidence. We also show how to accommodate the asymptomatic period characteristic to most diseases. For practical use, we produce an approximation of the model, which is subsequently shown accurate for relevant epidemic and sampling parameters. Both the approximation and the full model are applied to stochastic spatial simulations of epidemics. The results prove their consistency for a very wide range of situations.},

In addition to identifying pathogens more rapidly and precisely than traditional methods, high-throughput technologies and bioinformatics can provide new insights into disease transmission, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance. The US public health system is integrating pathogen genome sequencing into infectious disease surveillance with support from the Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) program, established by Congress at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2014. Population-level data on pathogen genomes in turn support the development of more precise and efficient clinical diagnostics.

Dual antiplatelet therapy was found to be superior to aspirin monotherapy. The authors used the number needed to treat (NNT) to communicate effect size, reporting that for every 8 patients treated with dual agents rather than aspirin alone, 1 additional patient would achieve saphenous graft patency at 1 year. The NNT may be defined as the number of patients who need to be treated with one therapy vs another for 1 additional patient to have the desired outcome.

To assess accuracy, Ontario antiviral prescriptions were compared to confirmed cases of influenza and cases of influenza-like-illness (ILI) from August 2009 to January 2015 and Nova Scotia sales of respiratory over-the-counter products (OTC) were compared to laboratory reports of respiratory pathogen detections from January 2014 to March 2015. Enteric outbreak data (2011-2014) from Nova Scotia were compared to sales of gastrointestinal products for the same time period. To assess utility, pharmacy sales of gastrointestinal products were monitored across Canada to detect unusual increases and reports were disseminated to the provinces and territories once a week between December 2014 and March 2015 and then a follow-up evaluation survey of stakeholders was conducted.
Results: Ontario prescriptions of antivirals between 2009 and 2015 correlated closely with the onset dates and magnitude of confirmed influenza cases. Nova Scotia sales of respiratory OTC products correlated with increases in non-influenza respiratory pathogens in the community. There were no definitive correlations identified between the occurrence of enteric outbreaks and the sales of gastrointestinal OTCs in Nova Scotia. Evaluation of national monitoring showed no significant increases in sales of gastrointestinal products that could be linked to outbreaks that included more than one province or territory.
Conclusion: Monitoring of pharmacy-based drug prescriptions and OTC sales can provide a timely and accurate complement to traditional respiratory public health surveillance activities but initial evaluation did not show that tracking gastrointestinal-related OTCs were of value in identifying an enteric disease outbreak in more than one province or territory during the study period.},

	Abstract = {On August 1, 2018, the Democratic Republic of Congo declared its 10th and largest outbreak of Ebola inflicting North Khivu and Ituri provinces. The spread of Ebola to Congolese urban centers along with deliberate attacks on the health care workers has hindered epidemiological surveillance activities, leading to substantial reporting delays. Reporting delays distort the epidemic incidence pattern and misrepresenting estimates of epidemic potential and the outbreak trajectory. To assess the impact of reporting delays, we conducted a real-time analysis of the dynamics of the ongoing Ebola outbreak in DRC using epidemiological data retrieved from the World Health Organization Situation Reports and Disease Outbreak News. We analyzed temporal trends in reporting delays, epidemic curves of crude and reporting-delay adjusted incidences and changes in the effective reproduction number, Rt. As of January 15, 2019, 663 Ebola cases have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The average reporting delay exhibited 81.1% decline from a mean of 17.4 weeks (95% CI 13-24.1) in May, 2018 to 3.3 weeks (95% CI 2.7-4.2) in September, 2018 (F-test statistic=44.9, p-value=0.0067). The Ebola epidemic has shown a two-wave pattern with the first surge in cases occurring between July 30-August 13, 2018 and the second on September 24, 2018. During the last 4 generation intervals, the trend in the mean Rt has exhibited a slight decline (rho=-0.37, P<0.001), fluctuating around 0.9 (range: 0-1.8). Our most recent estimate of R is at 0.9 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.1) during the last generation interval. Our most recent analysis of the Ebola outbreak in DRC indicates that the Ebola virus still active although transmission is characterized by a low fluctuating reproduction number. Yet, this pattern does not imply that the epidemic can be easily controlled particularly in the context of unstable epidemiological surveillance efforts hindered by unpredictable local violence.},

	Abstract = {Background: Households are important settings for the transmission of seasonal influenza. Previous studies found that the per-person risk of within-household transmission decreases with household size. However, more detailed heterogeneities driven by household composition and contact patterns have not been studied. Methods: We employed a mathematical model which accounts for infections both from outside and within the household. The model was applied to citywide primary school surveillance data of seasonal influenza in 2014/15 season in Matsumoto city, Japan. We compared a range of models to estimate the structure of household transmission. Results: Familial relationship and household composition strongly influenced the transmission patterns of seasonal influenza in households. Children had substantially high risk of infection from outside the household (up to 20\%) compared with adults (1-3\%). Intense transmission was observed within-generation (between children/parents/ grandparents) and also between mother and child, with transmission risks typically ranging around 5-20\% depending on the pair and household composition. Conclusions: We characterised heterogeneity in household transmission patterns of influenza. Children were identified as the largest source of secondary transmission, with family structure influencing infection risk. This suggests that vaccinating children would have stronger secondary effects on transmission than would be assumed without taking into account transmission patterns within the household.},

	Abstract = {Background
The discovery of the dynamics of seasonal and non-seasonal influenza outbreaks remains a great challenge. Previous internet-based surveillance studies built purely on internet or climate data do have potential error.
Methods
We collected influenza notifications, temperature and Google Trends (GT) data between January 1st, 2011 and December 31st, 2016. We performed time-series cross correlation analysis and temporal risk analysis to discover the characteristics of influenza epidemics in the period. Then, the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and regression tree model were developed to track influenza epidemics using GT and climate data.
Results
Influenza infection was significantly corrected with GT at lag of 1--7 weeks in Brisbane and Gold Coast, and temperature at lag of 1--10 weeks for the two study settings. SARIMA models with GT and temperature data had better predictive performance. We identified autoregression (AR) for influenza was the most important determinant for influenza occurrence in both Brisbane and Gold Coast.
Conclusions
Our results suggested internet search metrics in conjunction with temperature can be used to predict influenza outbreaks, which can be considered as a pre-requisite for constructing early warning systems using search and temperature data.},

	Abstract = {Dengue virus has shown a complex pattern of transmission across Latin America over the last two decades. In an attempt to explain the permanence of the disease in regions subjected to drought seasons lasting over six months, various hypotheses have been proposed. These include transovarial transmission, forest reservoirs and asymptomatic human virus carriers. Dengue virus is endemic in Mexico, a country in which half of the population is seropositive. Seropositivity is a risk factor for Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever upon a second encounter with the dengue virus. Since Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever can cause death, it is important to develop epidemiological mathematical tools that enable policy makers to predict regions potentially at risk for a dengue epidemic. We formulated a mathematical model of dengue transmission, considering both human behavior and environmental conditions pertinent to the transmission of the disease. When data on past human population density, temperature and rainfall were entered into this model, it provided an accurate picture of the actual spread of dengue over recent years in four states (representing two climactic conditions) in Mexico.},

@article{Waxman:2019,
	Abstract = {This work is concerned with the transmissibility of a disease, on observation of an outbreak of limited size. When such an outbreak occurs, an accurate estimate of the transmissibility of the responsible pathogen is essential for an appropriate response to future outbreaks. Transmissibility is usually characterised in terms of the reproduction number, R, which is the mean number of new cases of infection produced by a single infectious individual. A subcritical reproduction number (R<1) guarantees that an outbreak will eventually die out of its own accord. By contrast, a supercritical reproduction number (R>1) does not guarantee spread of the disease, since even with appreciable transmissibility, an outbreak may become extinct due to stochastic effects associated with a small number of infected individuals. Once the number of infectious individuals is conditioned on extinction, we show that an exact symmetry of the underlying theory ensures two distinct values of R, one larger than unity, the other smaller than unity, for which all outbreak properties are identical, with no signature of difference. Therefore a disease with a subcritical R, or its supercritical counterpart, when conditioned on extinction, have, for a given outbreak, identical individual likelihoods. In the full likelihood, this symmetry is lost, since the individual likelihood for a subcritical R is weighted by an extinction probability of unity, but the individual likelihood of a supercritical R is weighted by a sub-unity extinction probability. However, the inference can still benefit from the underlying symmetry, since it yields a mapping of all supercritical reproduction numbers onto the subcritical domain (R<1), thereby speeding up evaluation of the likelihood profile. The symmetry holds in the standard situation, where the distribution of secondary cases is Poisson, as well as where this distribution has a negative binomial form and super-spreading can occur.},

	Abstract = {Introduction Robust metrics for national-level preparedness are critical for assessing global resilience to epidemic and pandemic outbreaks. However, existing preparedness assessments focus primarily on public health systems or specific legislative frameworks, and do not measure other essential capacities that enable and support public health preparedness and response.Methods We developed an Epidemic Preparedness Index (EPI) to assess national-level preparedness. The EPI is global, covering 188 countries. It consists of five subindices measuring each country{\textquoteright}s economic resources, public health communications, infrastructure, public health systems and institutional capacity. To evaluate the construct validity of the EPI, we tested its correlation with proxy measures for preparedness and response capacity, including the timeliness of outbreak detection and reporting, as well as vaccination rates during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.Results The most prepared countries were concentrated in Europe and North America, while the least prepared countries clustered in Central and West Africa and Southeast Asia. Better prepared countries were found to report infectious disease outbreaks more quickly and to have vaccinated a larger proportion of their population during the 2009 pandemic.Conclusion The EPI measures a country{\textquoteright}s capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease events. Existing tools, such as the Joint External Evaluation (JEE), have been designed to measure preparedness within a country over time. The EPI complements the JEE by providing a holistic view of preparedness and is constructed to support comparative risk assessment between countries. The index can be updated rapidly to generate global estimates of pandemic preparedness that can inform strategy and resource allocation.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global genetic diversity of HIV-1 is a major challenge to the development of HIV vaccines. We aimed to estimate the regional and global distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants during 1990-2015.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (Ebscohost), and Global Health (Ovid) for HIV-1 subtyping studies published between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2015. We collected additional unpublished HIV-1 subtyping data through a global survey. We included prevalence studies with HIV-1 subtyping data collected during 1990-2015. We grouped countries into 14 regions and analysed data for four time periods (1990-99, 2000-04, 2005-09, and 2010-15). The distribution of HIV-1 subtypes, circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), and unique recombinant forms (URFs) in individual countries was weighted according to the UNAIDS estimates of the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in each country to generate regional and global estimates of HIV-1 diversity in each time period. The primary outcome was the number of samples designated as HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, CRFs, and URFs. The systematic review is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017067164.
FINDINGS: This systematic review and global survey yielded 2203 datasets with 383 519 samples from 116 countries in 1990-2015. Globally, subtype C accounted for 46·6% (16 280 897/34 921 639 of PLHIV) of all HIV-1 infections in 2010-15. Subtype B was responsible for 12·1% (4 235 299/34 921 639) of infections, followed by subtype A (10·3%; 3 587 003/34 921 639), CRF02_AG (7·7%; 2 705 110/34 921 639), CRF01_AE (5·3%; 1 840 982/34 921 639), subtype G (4·6%; 1 591 276/34 921 639), and subtype D (2·7%; 926 255/34 921 639). Subtypes F, H, J, and K combined accounted for 0·9% (311 332/34 921 639) of infections. Other CRFs accounted for 3·7% (1 309 082/34 921 639), bringing the proportion of all CRFs to 16·7% (5 844 113/34 921 639). URFs constituted 6·1% (2 134 405/34 921 639), resulting in recombinants accounting for 22·8% (7 978 517/34 921 639) of all global HIV-1 infections. The distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants changed over time in countries, regions, and globally. At a global level during 2005-15, subtype B increased, subtypes A and D were stable, and subtypes C and G and CRF02_AG decreased. CRF01_AE, other CRFs, and URFs increased, leading to a consistent increase in the global proportion of recombinants over time.
INTERPRETATION: Global and regional HIV diversity is complex and evolving, and is a major challenge to HIV vaccine development. Surveillance of the global molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 remains crucial for the design, testing, and implementation of HIV vaccines.

	Abstract = {The emergence and reemergence of coronavirus epidemics sparked renewed concerns from global epidemiology researchers and public health administrators. Mathematical models that represented how contact tracing and follow-up may control Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) transmissions were developed for evaluating different infection control interventions, estimating likely number of infections as well as facilitating understanding of their likely epidemiology. We reviewed mathematical models for contact tracing and follow-up control measures of SARS and MERS transmission. Model characteristics, epidemiological parameters and intervention parameters used in the mathematical models from seven studies were summarized. A major concern identified in future epidemics is whether public health administrators can collect all the required data for building epidemiological models in a short period of time during the early phase of an outbreak. Also, currently available models do not explicitly model constrained resources. We urge for closed-loop communication between public health administrators and modelling researchers to come up with guidelines to delineate the collection of the required data in the midst of an outbreak and the inclusion of additional logistical details in future similar models.},

	Abstract = {Background: We aimed to study respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genotype distribution, clinical presentation, and disease severity in infants with bronchiolitis from RSV subtypes and new RSV genotypes.
Methods: We prospectively enrolled previously healthy term infants less than 1 year old hospitalized for bronchiolitis in an Italian university hospital over 12 epidemic seasons. In 312 nasopharyngeal washings positive for RSV, we sequenced the viral genotype and analyzed this according to patient data. Strain-specific RSV loads were quantified for 273 specimens.
Results: From 2005-2006 to 2011-2012, the RSV-A genotype NA1 predominated, and was replaced in 2012 by the novel ON1. All infants infected with RSV subtype B were genotype BA. Stratifying data according to genotypes NA1, ON1, and BA showed that NA1-infected infants were the youngest and had the most severe clinical course. Conversely, BA-infected infants had less severe symptoms and more frequently had eosinophilia and a family history of asthma. Infants with the ON1 genotype had a milder clinical course than those with NA1 and more risk factors for asthma, despite having the highest viral loads.
Conclusion: The disease course in infants hospitalized for acute RSV bronchiolitis may depend on the RSV genotype.},

	Abstract = {Most evolutionary thinking is based on the notion of fitness and related ideas such as fitness landscapes and evolutionary optima. Nevertheless, it is often unclear what fitness actually is, and its meaning often depends on the context. Here we argue that fitness should not be a basal ingredient in verbal or mathematical descriptions of evolution. Instead, we propose that evolutionary birth-death processes, in which individuals give birth and die at ever-changing rates, should be the basis of evolutionary theory, because such processes capture the fundamental events that generate evolutionary dynamics. In evolutionary birth-death processes, fitness is at best a derived quantity, and owing to the potential complexity of such processes, there is no guarantee that there is a simple scalar, such as fitness, that would describe long-term evolutionary outcomes. We discuss how evolutionary birth-death processes can provide useful perspectives on a number of central issues in evolution.},

	Abstract = {The basic reproduction number (R0), also called the basic reproduction ratio or rate or the basic reproductive rate, is an epidemiologic metric used to describe the contagiousness or transmissibility of infectious agents. R0 is affected by numerous biological, sociobehavioral, and environmental factors that govern pathogen transmission and, therefore, is usually estimated with various types of complex mathematical models, which make R0 easily misrepresented, misinterpreted, and misapplied. R0 is not a biological constant for a pathogen, a rate over time, or a measure of disease severity, and R0 cannot be modified through vaccination campaigns. R0 is rarely measured directly, and modeled R0 values are dependent on model structures and assumptions. Some R0 values reported in the scientific literature are likely obsolete. R0 must be estimated, reported, and applied with great caution because this basic metric is far from simple.},

The 2015--2016 challenge consisted of weekly probabilistic forecasts of multiple targets, including fourteen models submitted by eleven teams. Forecast skill was evaluated using a modified logarithmic score. We averaged submitted forecasts into a mean ensemble model and compared them against predictions based on historical trends. Forecast skill was highest for seasonal peak intensity and short-term forecasts, while forecast skill for timing of season onset and peak week was generally low. Higher forecast skill was associated with team participation in previous influenza forecasting challenges and utilization of ensemble forecasting techniques. The mean ensemble consistently performed well and outperformed historical trend predictions. CDC and contributing teams will continue to advance influenza forecasting and work to improve the accuracy and reliability of forecasts to facilitate increased incorporation into public health response efforts.},

	Abstract = {Background: Epidemiological surveillance of HIV infection in Japan involves two technical problems for directly applying a classical backcalculation method, i.e., (i) all AIDS cases are not counted over time and (ii) people diagnosed with HIV have received antiretroviral therapy, extending the incubation period. The present study aimed to address these issues and estimate the HIV incidence and the proportion of diagnosed HIV infections, using a simple statistical model.
Methods: From among Japanese nationals, yearly incidence data of HIV diagnoses and patients with AIDS who had not previously been diagnosed as HIV positive, from 1985 to 2017, were analyzed. Using the McKendrick partial differential equation, general convolution-like equations were derived, allowing estimation of the HIV incidence and the time-dependent rate of diagnosis. A likelihood-based approach was used to obtain parameter estimates.
Results: Assuming that the median incubation period was 10.0 years, the cumulative number of HIV infections was estimated to be 29,613 (95% confidence interval (CI): 29,059, 30,167) by the end of 2017, and the proportion of diagnosed HIV infections was estimated at 80.3% (95% CI [78.7%-82.0%]). Allowing the median incubation period to range from 7.5 to 12.3 years, the estimate of the proportion diagnosed can vary from 77% to 84%.
Discussion: The proportion of diagnosed HIV infections appears to have not yet reached 90% among Japanese nationals. Compared with the peak incidence from 2005-2008, new HIV infections have clearly been in a declining trend; however, there are still more than 1,000 new HIV infections per year in Japan. To increase the diagnosed proportion of HIV infections, it is critical to identify people who have difficulty accessing consultation, testing, and care, and to explore heterogeneous patterns of infection.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contact tracing can provide accurate information on relevant parameters of an ongoing emerging infectious disease outbreak. This is crucial to investigators seeking to control such an outbreak. However, crude contact tracing data are difficult to interpret and methods for analyzing these data are scarce. We present a method to estimate and visualize key outbreak parameters from contact tracing information in real time by taking into account data censoring.
METHODS/RESULTS: Exposure type-specific attack rates and the reproduction number R(t) are estimated from contact tracing data by using maximum likelihood estimation to account for censored data. The attack rates reflect, in the context of contact tracing, the specificity of the contact definition; a higher value indicates relatively efficient contact tracing. The evolution of R(t) over time provides information regarding the effectiveness of interventions. To allow a real-time overview of the outbreak, the attack rates and the evolution of R(t) over time are visualized together with the case-contact network and epicurve. We applied the method to a well-documented smallpox outbreak in The Netherlands to demonstrate the added value.
CONCLUSION: Our method facilitates the analysis of contact tracing information by quickly turning it into accessible information, helping outbreak investigators to make real-time decisions to more effectively and efficiently control infectious disease outbreaks.},

	Abstract = {Seasonal influenza surveillance is usually carried out by sentinel general practitioners who compile weekly reports based on the number of influenza-like illness (ILI) clinical cases observed among visited patients. This practice for surveillance is generally affected by two main issues: i) reports are usually released with a lag of about one week or more, ii) the definition of a case of influenza-like illness based on patients symptoms varies from one surveillance system to the other, i.e. from one country to the other. The availability of novel data streams for disease surveillance can alleviate these issues; in this paper, we employed data from Influenzanet, a participatory web-based surveillance project which collects symptoms directly from the general population in real time. We developed an unsupervised probabilistic framework that combines time series analysis of symptoms counts and performs an algorithmic detection of groups of symptoms, hereafter called, syndrome. Symptoms counts were collected through the participatory web-based surveillance platforms of a consortium called Influenzanet which is found to correlate with Influenza-like illness incidence as detected by sentinel doctors. Our aim is to suggest how web-based surveillance data can provide an epidemiological signal capable of detecting influenza-like illness{\textquoteright} temporal trends without relying on a specific case definition. We evaluated the performance of our framework by showing that the temporal trends of the detected syndromes closely follow the ILI incidence as reported by the traditional surveillance, and consist of combinations of symptoms that are compatible with the ILI definition. The proposed framework was able to predict quite accurately the ILI trend of the forthcoming influenza season based only on the available information of the previous years. Moreover, we assessed the generalisability of the approach by evaluating its potentials for the detection of gastrointestinal syndromes. We evaluated the approach against the traditional surveillance data and despite the limited amount of data, the gastrointestinal trend was successfully detected. The result is a real-time flexible surveillance and prediction tool that is not constrained by any disease case definition.},

	Abstract = { Abstract Questions remain regarding how the skill of operational probabilistic forecasts is most usefully evaluated or compared, even though probability forecasts have been a long-standing aim in meteorological forecasting. This paper explains the importance of employing proper scores when selecting between the various measures of forecast skill. It is demonstrated that only proper scores provide internally consistent evaluations of probability forecasts, justifying the focus on proper scores independent of any attempt to influence the behavior of a forecaster. Another property of scores (i.e., locality) is discussed. Several scores are examined in this light. There is, effectively, only one proper, local score for probability forecasts of a continuous variable. It is also noted that operational needs of weather forecasts suggest that the current concept of a score may be too narrow; a possible generalization is motivated and discussed in the context of propriety and locality. },

	Abstract = {Outbreaks of novel pathogens such as SARS, pandemic influenza and Ebola require substantial investments in reactive interventions, with consequent implementation plans sometimes revised on a weekly basis. Therefore, short-term forecasts of incidence are often of high priority. In light of the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa, a forecasting exercise was convened by a network of infectious disease modellers. The challenge was to forecast unseen "future" simulated data for four different scenarios at five different time points. In a similar method to that used during the recent Ebola epidemic, we estimated current levels of transmissibility, over variable time-windows chosen in an ad hoc way. Current estimated transmissibility was then used to forecast near-future incidence. We performed well within the challenge and often produced accurate forecasts. A retrospective analysis showed that our subjective method for deciding on the window of time with which to estimate transmissibility often resulted in the optimal choice. However, when near-future trends deviated substantially from exponential patterns, the accuracy of our forecasts was reduced. This exercise highlights the urgent need for infectious disease modellers to develop more robust descriptions of processes - other than the widespread depletion of susceptible individuals - that produce non-exponential patterns of incidence.},

	Abstract = {Influenza infects an estimated 9-35 million individuals each year in the United States and is a contributing cause for between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths annually. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza are common in temperate regions of the world, with highest incidence typically occurring in colder and drier months of the year. Real-time forecasts of influenza transmission can inform public health response to outbreaks. We present the results of a multiinstitution collaborative effort to standardize the collection and evaluation of forecasting models for influenza in the United States for the 2010/2011 through 2016/2017 influenza seasons. For these seven seasons, we assembled weekly real-time forecasts of seven targets of public health interest from 22 different models. We compared forecast accuracy of each model relative to a historical baseline seasonal average. Across all regions of the United States, over half of the models showed consistently better performance than the historical baseline when forecasting incidence of influenza-like illness 1 wk, 2 wk, and 3 wk ahead of available data and when forecasting the timing and magnitude of the seasonal peak. In some regions, delays in data reporting were strongly and negatively associated with forecast accuracy. More timely reporting and an improved overall accessibility to novel and traditional data sources are needed to improve forecasting accuracy and its integration with real-time public health decision making.},

@article{Roosa:2019aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical modeling is now frequently used in outbreak investigations to understand underlying mechanisms of infectious disease dynamics, assess patterns in epidemiological data, and forecast the trajectory of epidemics. However, the successful application of mathematical models to guide public health interventions lies in the ability to reliably estimate model parameters and their corresponding uncertainty. Here, we present and illustrate a simple computational method for assessing parameter identifiability in compartmental epidemic models.
METHODS: We describe a parametric bootstrap approach to generate simulated data from dynamical systems to quantify parameter uncertainty and identifiability. We calculate confidence intervals and mean squared error of estimated parameter distributions to assess parameter identifiability. To demonstrate this approach, we begin with a low-complexity SEIR model and work through examples of increasingly more complex compartmental models that correspond with applications to pandemic influenza, Ebola, and Zika.
RESULTS: Overall, parameter identifiability issues are more likely to arise with more complex models (based on number of equations/states and parameters). As the number of parameters being jointly estimated increases, the uncertainty surrounding estimated parameters tends to increase, on average, as well. We found that, in most cases, R0 is often robust to parameter identifiability issues affecting individual parameters in the model. Despite large confidence intervals and higher mean squared error of other individual model parameters, R0 can still be estimated with precision and accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Because public health policies can be influenced by results of mathematical modeling studies, it is important to conduct parameter identifiability analyses prior to fitting the models to available data and to report parameter estimates with quantified uncertainty. The method described is helpful in these regards and enhances the essential toolkit for conducting model-based inferences using compartmental dynamic models.},

@article{Vandormael:2018aa,
	Abstract = {Background: It is common to use the mid-point between the latest-negative and earliest-positive test dates as the date of the infection event. However, the accuracy of the mid-point method has yet to be systematically quantified for incidence studies once participants start to miss their scheduled test dates.
Methods: We used a simulation-based approach to generate an infectious disease epidemic for an incidence cohort with a high (80-100%), moderate (60-79.9%), low (40-59.9%) and poor (30-39.9%) testing rate. Next, we imputed a mid-point and random-point value between the participant's latest-negative and earliest-positive test dates. We then compared the incidence rate derived from these imputed values with the true incidence rate generated from the simulation model.
Results: The mid-point incidence rate estimates erroneously declined towards the end of the observation period once the testing rate dropped below 80%. This decline was in error of approximately 9%, 27% and 41% for a moderate, low and poor testing rate, respectively. The random-point method did not introduce any systematic bias in the incidence rate estimate, even for testing rates as low as 30%.
Conclusions: The mid-point assumption of the infection date is unjustified and should not be used to calculate the incidence rate once participants start to miss the scheduled test dates. Under these conditions, we show an artefactual decline in the incidence rate towards the end of the observation period. Alternatively, the single random-point method is straightforward to implement and produces estimates very close to the true incidence rate.},

	Abstract = {Current estimates of the HIV epidemic indicate a decrease in the incidence of the disease in the undiagnosed subpopulation over the past 10 years. However, a lack of access to care has not been considered when modeling the population. Populations at high risk for contracting HIV are twice as likely to lack access to reliable medical care. In this paper, we consider three contributors to the HIV population dynamics: at-risk population exhaustion, lack of access to care, and usage of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) by diagnosed individuals. An extant problem in the mathematical study of this system is deriving parameter estimates due to a portion of the population being unobserved. We approach this problem by looking at the proportional change in the infected subpopulations. We obtain conservative estimates for the proportional change of the infected subpopulations using hierarchical Bayesian statistics. The estimated proportional change is used to derive epidemic parameter estimates for a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Model fit is quantified to determine the best parametric explanation for the observed dynamics in the infected subpopulations. Parameter estimates derived using these methods produce simulations that closely follow the dynamics observed in the data, as well as values that are generally in agreement with prior understanding of transmission and diagnosis rates. Simulations suggest that the undiagnosed population may be larger than currently estimated without significantly affecting the population dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Following rapid, global clonal dominance of hypervirulent ribotypes, Clostridium difficile now constitutes the primary infectious cause of nosocomial diarrhoea. Evidence indicates at least three possible mechanisms of hypervirulence that facilitates the successful invasion of these atypical strains: 1) increased infectiousness relative to endemic strains; 2) increased symptomatic disease rate relative to endemic strains; and 3) an ability to outcompete endemic strains in the host's gut. Stochastic simulations of an infection transmission model demonstrate clear differences between the invasion potentials of C. difficile strains utilising the alternative hypervirulence mechanisms, and provide new evidence that favours certain mechanisms (1 and 2) more than others (3). Additionally, simulations illustrate that direct competition between strains (inside the host's gut) is not a prerequisite for the sudden switching that has been observed in prevailing ribotypes; previously dominant C. difficile strains can be excluded by hypervirulent ribotypes through indirect (exploitative) competition. },

The two predictive techniques behind the ensemble utilize (1) a self-correcting statistical method combining influenza-related Google search frequencies, information from electronic health records, and historical flu trends within each state, and (2) a network-based approach leveraging spatio-temporal synchronicities observed in historical influenza activity across states. The ensemble considerably outperforms each component method in addition to previously proposed state-specific methods for influenza tracking, with higher correlations and lower prediction errors.},

	Abstract = {Infectious disease outbreaks recapitulate biology: they emerge from the multi-level interaction of hosts, pathogens, and their shared environment. As a result, predicting when, where, and how far diseases will spread requires a complex systems approach to modeling. Recent studies have demonstrated that predicting different components of outbreaks--e.g., the expected number of cases, pace and tempo of cases needing treatment, demand for prophylactic equipment, importation probability etc.--is feasible. Therefore, advancing both the science and practice of disease forecasting now requires testing for the presence of fundamental limits to outbreak prediction. To investigate the question of outbreak prediction, we study the information theoretic limits to forecasting across a broad set of infectious diseases using permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability. Studying the predictability of a diverse collection of historical outbreaks--including, chlamydia, dengue, gonorrhea, hepatitis A, influenza, measles, mumps, polio, and whooping cough--we identify a fundamental entropy barrier for infectious disease time series forecasting. However, we find that for most diseases this barrier to prediction is often well beyond the time scale of single outbreaks. We also find that the forecast horizon varies by disease and demonstrate that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are the most likely mechanisms for the observed differences across contagions. Our results highlight the importance of moving beyond time series forecasting, by embracing dynamic modeling approaches, and suggest challenges for performing model selection across long time series. We further anticipate that our findings will contribute to the rapidly growing field of epidemiological forecasting and may relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.},
